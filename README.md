## Comments

The repo is an ongoing attempt to enhance some articles on the CrossWire developers' wiki and maybe some software. It is ongoing because it became messy due to unplanned investigation, and training/learning. The following web-sites existed first ...

- [CrossWire developers' wiki](https://wiki.crosswire.org/Main_Page). 
- [bishop front-end](http://git.crosswire.org/main/bishop.git) also known as an app on Google Play [and possibly the Apple store].
- [sword tunk](https://crosswire.org/svn/sword/trunk/) for C/C++ source code
- [JSword](https://www.crosswire.org/jsword/svn.html). The Java implementation not yet analyzed here.


Pieces of documents that were not yet observed on the CrossWire wiki:
- [concept/goals, agreements, etc](https://sword-2.github.io/sword-wiki/1a_initial/1_concept/1.html)

## Disclaimer
The repo may contain some filing concepts observed from the local Caesar (Government). The bible information intends to distribute as much a possible with a lot of the control being just preserving scripture, word definitions, and teachings. Thus the purpose of bible distribution may be different than the purpose of the filing system.
