<h3 id=a>Goals</h3>
<p>Tables a1-a4 capture some simple goals. The name for each goal group/table are a1 - scripture distribution, a2 - teaching aids, a3 - church business, and a4 - stewardship.</p>

<p>Columns were added that sometimes identify what may be considered unique or partly unique with footnotes at the end of each table. Individual contributors may have varying goals - this was just an attempt to capture something for potential discussion.</p>

		<td>distribute scripture to as many people within a domain as possible-electronic</td>
		<td><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/about/">Existing</a></td>
		<td>Users and operators should be able to study the bible without making compromises. That includes not having to compromise by using a platform other than their favorite.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>a1-2</td>
		<td>*2</td>
		<td>distribute scripture to as many people within a domain as possible-paper</td>
		<td>Consideration</td>
		<td>Some people don't like electronic devices or may not have one. Paper printouts may help this group. After an hour or so of troubleshooting errors on their electronic device, where the errors may or may not be from SWORD software, these users can become tired and want a paper bible. The goal doesn't mean actual printing, but preparing the capability if others chose to use it for printing.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>a1-3</td>
		<td>*3</td>
		<td>Bible Text translation</td>
		<td>Consideration</td>
		<td>Preserve texts from original languages like Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic as preparation to allow a software translator or translators to go direct from an original language to the large number of destination languages. A bible expert could be needed to assess variations in what the scribes may have done if there are variations in the originals.</td>
	</tr>

</table>
	<ul>
		<li>*1 - Only unique relative to organizations not developing bible software and to software that is not multi-platform.</li>
		<li>*2 - A spot check of mobile apps and web sites has not encountered much for generating paper bibles. Some large files were observed that might be printed, but are not for dual use with a bible app.</li>
		<li>*3 - Unique compared to programs that serve the English speaking groups first. This goal / component attempts to skip preference for the English sub-group to serve all groups equally, except for those groups affiliated with the original languages. The bible has examples in the past and future that did not require attendance of English speaking nations/groups.</li>
	</ul>


Teaching aids use the concept that computer memory can aid human memory (reference PSCF #3). Teaching aids that can be accessed quickly and easily may be recycled into the present and not be forgotten.

<p>These goals are just to watch for opportunities for dual use of software to consolidate functionality to the bible app. There could be instances where a bible app can easily include a certain function so the user can get it in one app instead of installing a bunch of apps. If the functionality is not easy to integrate, the goal may not work.</p>

Code in the report was observed in a SWORD project source file xml2gbs.cpp. Those only running swift on Linux do not have MSVC to investigate this.

Was there no possibility of having something like a W3C recommendation that facilitates interoperability between different organizations.

	<br>Motives for comments included 1) the SWORD project C++ source currently using SVN. K-12 computer science standards in California may be a different process than bible development, but these had concept of being inclusive in computing.

A list of a few programs with potential to shift from C/C++ to swift was started in the following table. If someone expected language shifts from C/C++ to swift to have already occurred, they could be disappointed. A sermon titled <a href="https://www.faithtoyou.com/matthew-62434">Why work?</a> generically taught about Matt 6:24-34, but was not specific to software. Extrapolating the lesson to software specifics may or may not go to far, but if attempted, the following sections were noted. There can be business (software) help but it does not always occur like for a gentile in a self help business seminar (times 29:25-30:40). It is possible to worry the future has a lot of work to do, but the lesson teaches don't worry about tomorrow because each day has enough trouble of its own (32:39-34:34). Last, it is possible to invest in the kingdom according to the parable of the talents (38:01-39:32), if a language shift invests in the bible apps?
