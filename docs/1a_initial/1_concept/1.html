<h3 id=a>Goals</h3>
<p>Tables a1-a4 capture some simple goals. The name for each goal group/table are a1 - scripture distribution, a2 - teaching aids, a3 - church business, and a4 - stewardship. The majority of a3/church business is mostly more applications for modules even if the module is just a simple generic book (genbook).</p>

<p>Columns were added that sometimes identify what may be considered unique or partly unique with footnotes at the end of each table. Individual contributors may have varying goals which might have been missed.</p>

Teaching aids use the concept that computer memory can aid human memory (reference PSCF #3). Teaching aids that can be accessed quickly and easily may be recycled into the present and not be forgotten.

No agreements were made - the tables just identify some tools, resources, or perceived status.

<p>More goals were circulating, thus someone might not keep track of all of them (not multi-task between them). According to an <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450296755/Why-Apple-is-wooing-open-source-developers-with-Swift">article</a>, the GitHub CEO said "Everyone know[s] Apple wants to make Swift a great programming platform so it can continue to sell more iPhones."</p>

	<td>Safety, Law, and Ethics</td>
	<td>Unrealistic expectation</td>
	<td>No</td>
	<td>Caesar's plan for the overarching software community was great, but different than separate memory safety plans on Apple, Microsoft, Linux, etc operating systems. An instance for an Apple unique memory safety plan was observed.
	<br>The documentation for a simple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/print(_:separator:terminator:)">print function</a> does not have a section on limitations, and at the top identifies the scope of Apple Operating Systems (vs the overarching community). Inconsistent output for print statements was observed in a swift test case run in a Linux terminal. After this observation, several bugs on print anomalies were found on the internet: <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/issues/422">XCTest: Stdio not output at correct point</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/issues/405">SR-752</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/issues/43740">SR-1127</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/issues/4752">SR-9133</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57095407/swift-print-doesnt-appear-in-stdout-but-3rd-party-c-library-logs-do-when-runn">swift "print" doesn't appear in STDOut but 3rd party c library logs do when running in docker on ECS</a>, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66879547/xcode-unit-testing-cant-get-print-commands-to-display-consistently-while-unit">Xcode Unit Testing - Can't get print commands to display consistently while unit tests running</a>.
	<br>Unexpected program output was a perceived memory safety risk since a Linux sub-shell can assign the (print) output to variables.

<tr>
	<td>Safety, Law, and Ethics</td>
	<td>Software risks not thoroughly identified</td>

<td>The K-12 core concept of Impacts of Computing included Safety, Law, and Ethics. If a regular person or one of Caesar's inspectors watched a software build that runs older C/C++ code and observes a bunch of warnings scroll across the screen, the person or inspector is less likely to have peace of mind about the goals for safety, law, and ethics. According to one <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8598354/why-is-msvc10-ignoring-my-pragma-warningdisable-4251">article</a>, a bunch of warnings might occur when building with some compilers according to the following lines of code found in the xml2gbs.cpp source file of the SWORD project.

What about swift having something like C's SWIG?

	<td>No</td>
	<td>The library of Congress was estimated to format catalogs, books, files in both XML format and MAchine-Readable Cataloging (MARC) 21. The library's <a href="https://www.loc.gov/cds/products/MDSConnect-books_all.html">MDSConnect page</a> lists both UTF8 (for MARC 21) and XML. According to a Wikipedia on <a href="https://wiki.code4lib.org/Working_with_MARC#MARC_Programming_Libraries">Working with MARC</a>, Apple swift was not currently listed as having a software library to process MARC 21 records. On the Wikipedia, C++ was listed as having a software library for MARC. Thus, migrating to swift could loose a MARC capability currently present for C++, according to this table. The cataloging was of interest to catalog SWORD modules at least while the OSIS User's Group was inactive.
<br>Of course the K-12 standards had core practices for collaboration and communication that possibly will encourage having a swift library.
<br><br>A bug due to missing newline in a MARC 21 file was observed as mentioned in this <a href="https://counting.substack.com/p/lets-play-with-some-library-of-congress">post</a>. That post downloaded the biggest file. To go faster, just part 1 of the UTF (MARC 21) was downloaded. The warning about no end of line was observed when opening the part 1 file in the vim editor after running gunzip.
