<h3 id=a>Goals</h3>
<p>Tables a1-a4 capture some simple goals. The name for each goal group/table are a1 - scripture distribution, a2 - teaching aids, a3 - church business, and a4 - stewardship. The majority of a3/church business is mostly more applications for modules even if the module is just a simple generic book (genbook).</p>

<p>Columns were added that sometimes identify what may be considered unique or partly unique with footnotes at the end of each table. Individual contributors may have varying goals which might have been missed.</p>

Teaching aids use the concept that computer memory can aid human memory (reference PSCF #3). Teaching aids that can be accessed quickly and easily may be recycled into the present and not be forgotten.

Some tags for swift were observed in the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/swift/info">About page</a>. Consider identifying if that set was recommended by the lead for that language (Apple). A comment about their selection occurred for a few reasons. First, those tag categories were observed to differ compared to the file <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/CODE_OWNERS.TXT">CODE_OWNERS.TXT</a>. Also, they look like Apple tags thus someone programming in swift on Linux may find it harder to get a practical tag. </td></tr>

The tag ipados was entered in the <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchangecom/tags">stackexchange web page<a>, but not observed. Maybe the tags are supposed to be different. A history on the tag development could help potential site users increase confidence for those tags.</td></tr>

Motives for comments included 1) the SWORD project C++ source was using SVN, and 2) K-12 computer science standards in California had concept of being inclusive in computing. Are the maintenance costs due to SVN, github, or both? If SVN, do any costs identify certain subcomponents within SVN to form a request to the SVN community to reduce the costs? Is there no guidance comparable for W3C standards for web development that allows multiple browsers to operate the same protocols instead of splitting off and being incompatible programs. If the support has to be dropped, is there worth in a training example to teach about times when it is necessary to dropping support instead of have an inclusive computing concept?</td>
