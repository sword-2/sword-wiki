<h3 id=a>Goals</h3>
<p>Tables a1-a4 capture some simple goals. The name for each goal group/table are a1 - scripture distribution, a2 - teaching aids, a3 - church business, and a4 - stewardship.</p>

<p>Columns were added that sometimes identify what may be considered unique or partly unique with footnotes at the end of each table. Individual contributors may have varying goals - this was just an attempt to capture something for potential discussion.</p>

		<td>*1</td>
		<td>distribute scripture to as many people within a domain as possible-electronic</td>
		<td><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/about/">Existing</a></td>
		<td>Users and operators should be able to study the bible without making compromises. That includes not having to compromise by using a platform other than their favorite.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>a1-2</td>
		<td>*2</td>
		<td>distribute scripture to as many people within a domain as possible-paper</td>
		<td>Consideration</td>
		<td>Some people don't like electronic devices or may not have one. Paper printouts may help this group. After an hour or so of troubleshooting errors on their electronic device, where the errors may or may not be from SWORD software, these users can become tired and want a paper bible. The goal doesn't mean actual printing, but preparing the capability if others chose to use it for printing.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>a1-3</td>
		<td>*3</td>
		<td>Original bible texts</td>
		<td>Consideration</td>
		<td>As it is possible, participate to preserve texts from original languages like Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic. Other languages including English are mostly destination languages, a destination for the translator to convert the scriptures to.
		<br>Special data file formats and software code is likely for this.</td>
	</tr>

</table>
	<ul>
		<li>*1 - Only unique relative to organizations not developing bible software and to software that is not multi-platform.</li>
		<li>*2 - A spot check of mobile apps and web sites has not encountered much for generating paper bibles. Some large files were observed that might be printed, but are not for dual use with a bible app.</li>
		<li>*3 - Have not always observed the ability to swap the list of old testament books in a table of contents between the English order and the Hebrew order.</li>
	</ul>


Teaching aids use the concept that computer memory can aid human memory (reference PSCF #3). Teaching aids that can be accessed quickly and easily may be recycled into the present and not be forgotten.

<p>These goals are optional to watch for opportunities for dual use of software or data formats. There may be ways where a bible app can easily re-use data or function for more capability. This instead of installing a bunch of apps. But it also might not occur, this optional.</p>
