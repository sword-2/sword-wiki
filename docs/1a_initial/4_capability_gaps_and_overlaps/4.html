<h2 id=4>Capability Gaps and Overlaps or Redundancies</h2>
<tr>
<h3>gaps</h3>

 Some perceived gaps included ...

<table border=1><caption></caption>
<tr>
	<th>goal</th>
	<th>Comment</th>

<tr>
	<td>a1-3</td>
	<td>variable graphical environment interfaces that an operator uses. As the variability increases, more front ends may appear. This excludes web browsers which may run the same html, css, and JavaScript interfaces.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>a2-3, a2-4</td>
	<td>"socket" inter-process communication like in the C days or newer equivalent can help with network connections such as downloading library materials and maybe relaying traffic for audio/video conferences. Sometimes a networking computer [library] might be used to cover this area instead of managing the interface.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>a1-5</td>
	<td>Where OSS programs multiplied a lot, it is uncertain if all the details can be comprehended.</td>

<h3>Redundancies</h3>

<p>Redundancies this time were considered in terms of shared code from the internals of any related (peripheral) programs. The list is only partial. Not all of the programs were focused to church business, nor were the details understood at this time to identify any code reuse.</p>
