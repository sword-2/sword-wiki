<h2>Threat [C/C++ and memory safety]</h2>


<h3>Caesar (Government)</h3>
<p>An <a href="https://sword-2.github.io/sword-wiki/1a_initial/8b_references/8b.html#Caesar">information sheet</a> from Caesar once appeared the browsers google search start page. Interest occurred in the content because there are many programming languages that can produce confusion assuming most programmers do not do all of them at the same time. Limiting the quantity of languages could help reduce confusion. Of course, typical market operation may encourage a bunch of languages such that this is normal. In any case, the info sheet sheet was summarized as preferring certain computer programming languages and migrating away from C/C++.</p>

<h3>Language considerations</h3>
<p>One of the SWORD engines was already in Java, a language the information sheet encouraged. This page intended to apply the Swift language for personal reasons. The first personal reason was that if it was necessary to move out of C/C++, moving to the newest language allowed to modernize, given Java was from 1995 and swift from 2014.  2) swift advertised backward compatibility to C / C++. Goal a4-6 identifies there is possible language (perl) from a believer - the status of that languages is not currently known.</p>

<h3>Perceived challenges</h3>
<p>A lot of challenges could go out of scope of the project. Since swift was partly caused by Caesar, some categories from K-12 were added.</p>

	<td>Reference discontinuity (part 1/2).
	<br>In 1998, a document on <a href="https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=114847">software development and documentation (MIL-STD-498 notice 1)</a> was canceled. It handed effort off to IEEE/EIA 12207. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_12207">Wikipedia article</a> for IEEE/EIA 12207 was not observed to comment software memory safety. Also, the works cited in the information sheet did not refer to the IEEE/EIA. The discontinuity between documents could indicate risk that more changes to the information sheet could appear in the future. And any changes had potential to affect someone who began effort from the old information sheet.</td>

<tr>
	<td>Collaborating Around Computing</td>
	<td>Goals beyond scope</td>
	<td>a4-4</td>
	<td>The information sheet uses term "malicious actor", where the word "malicious" can be found in the bible. Psalm 36:4 (CSB) Even on his bed he makes malicious plans. He sets himself on a path that is not good and does not reject evil. Some church sermons were put that touch upon <a href="https://sword-2.github.io/sword-wiki/1a_initial/8b_references/8b.html#church">sin</a>. While all have sinned per Romans 3:23, it was assumed most people are not malicious at least for computer software. Even computer folks might receive the goal different, like through <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/csstandards.pdf">school grades K-12</a>. Also, developer documentation could have encouraged people to certain programming languages. For example, some package manager commands for installing C/C++ tools include "apt show g++" and "apt show clang". These commands produce a summary for those tools, but do not steer the developer or administrator to a safe language.</td>

<tr>
	<td>-</td>
	<td>Software Risks not thoroughly identified</td>
	<td>a4-4</td>
	<td>The information sheet uses the phrase "overarching software community". If any of the recommended languages did something that had a smaller scope, there is a risk of thinking the phrase carries over from the info sheet to application. It was assumed software has a bad reputation in part due to unexpected surprises not understood at the beginning.
