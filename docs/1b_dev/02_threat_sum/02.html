<h2>Threat [C/C++ and memory safety]</h2>


<h3>Caesar (Government)</h3>
<p>An information sheet on <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Apr/27/2003210083/-1/-1/0/CSI_SOFTWARE_MEMORY_SAFETY_V1.1.PDF">Software Memory Safety</a> once appeared in google search page. Interest occurred in the content because there are many programming languages that can exceed the memory capacity of some people. Anything to limit the quantity may help simplify. Of course, typical market operation may encourage a bunch of languages. However, the info sheet sheet was summarized as preferring certain computer programming languages and migrating away from C/C++.</p>


<h3>Application</h3>
<p>One of the SWORD engines was already in Java, a language the information sheet encouraged. This page gave attention to the Swift language for personal reasons of 1) it was a relatively newer language in the sheet's list and 2) swift advertised backward compatibility to C / C++. An individual who came out of C / C++ and hadn't yet learned Java might investigate the newest language, swift in this case.</p>

<h3>Perceived challenges</h3>
<p>Would using swift be an early plan that was relatively subjective, involved numerous assumptions, and was overly optimistic? This was to be determined. If a challenge was perceived and related to something about Caesar, it was listed below. Perceived challenges more related to the private sector or academics were being moved to another web page on agreements.</p>

	<td>Reference discontinuity (part 1/2).
	<br>In 1998, a document on <a href="https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=114847">software development and documentation (MIL-STD-498 notice 1)</a> was canceled. It handed effort off to IEEE/EIA 12207. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_12207">Wikipedia article</a> for IEEE/EIA 12207 was not observed to comment software memory safety. Also, the works cited in the information sheet did not refer to the IEEE/EIA. If the Wikipedia and information sheet works cite cross-reference, there would be less perception of discontinuity (risk).

	<td>No</td>
	<td>Reference discontinuity (part 2/2).
	<br>Reference disconnections can be good for the folks that don't want and don't need to be directly involved with the information sheet and the term "malicious actor", Like someone could disconnect from acting malicious, they might also disconnect from sin - some sermons touch on it: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YkPgUWmRM0k">Whatever happened to sin? (1 Corinthians 5)</a> and <a href="https://www.faithtoyou.com/titus-21115-kornoff">lessons learned (Titus 2:11-15).
	<br>One opportunity for disconnection may be to put the goals in <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/csstandards.pdf">school grades K-12</a> for folks to receive them in a common normal setting.
	<br>A second opportunity for disconnection is to put it in developer documentation. Some package manager commands for installing C/C++ tools include "apt show g++" and "apt show clang". These commands produce a summary for those tools. The description from those commands does not currently say deprecated in favor of the safe languages, but could if someone put it there.</td>

	<td>-</td>
	<td>Scope
	<br>The information sheet identifies a plan for the "overarching software community". The information sheet has disclaimer of endorsement at the end. That disclaimer is generic and doesn't identify anything with a scope less than an overarching community. If anything has a smaller scope, identifying that may help a reader avoid risk of thinking the scope is more that the reality.
