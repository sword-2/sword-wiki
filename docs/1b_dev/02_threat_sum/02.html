<h2>Threat [C/C++ and memory safety]</h2>


<h3>Caesar (Government)</h3>
<p>An information sheet on <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Apr/27/2003210083/-1/-1/0/CSI_SOFTWARE_MEMORY_SAFETY_V1.1.PDF">Software Memory Safety</a> once appeared in google search page. Interest occurred in the content because there are many programming languages that can exceed the memory capacity of some people. Anything to limit the quantity may help simplify. Of course, typical market operation may encourage a bunch of languages. However, the info sheet sheet was summarized as preferring certain computer programming languages and migrating away from C/C++.</p>


<h3>Application</h3>
<p>One of the SWORD engines was already in Java, a language the information sheet encouraged. This page gave attention to the Swift language for personal reasons of 1) it was a relatively newer language in the sheet's list and 2) swift advertised backward compatibility to C / C++. An individual who came out of C / C++ and hadn't yet learned Java might investigate the newest language, swift in this case.</p>

<h3>Perceived challenges</h3>
<p>Would using swift be an early plan that was relatively subjective, involved numerous assumptions, and was overly optimistic? This was to be determined. If a challenge was perceived and related to something about Caesar, it was listed below. Perceived challenges more related to the private sector or academics were being moved to another web page on agreements.</p>

	<td>Reference discontinuity (part 1/3).
	<br>In 1998, a document on <a href="https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=114847">software development and documentation (MIL-STD-498 notice 1)</a> was canceled. It handed effort off to IEEE/EIA 12207. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_12207">Wikipedia article</a> for IEEE/EIA 12207 was not observed to comment software memory safety. Also, the works cited in the information sheet did not refer to the IEEE/EIA. If the Wikipedia and information sheet works cite cross-reference, there would be less perception of discontinuity (risk).

	<td>Reference discontinuity (part 2/3).
	<br>Goals for <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/csstandards.pdf">school grades K-12</a> identified network safety, but memory safety was not observed. Including computer memory safety goals for grades K-12 gives a bunch more folks a way to attempt the goal without needing the information sheet. Assuming most people start out for other reasons than the information sheet, they can go with the discontinuity using the K-12 stuff. Disconnection from the phrase "malicious actor" may be compared to disconnecting from sin. According to Romans 3:23 everyone is a sinner, and some sermons that touch on it include <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YkPgUWmRM0k">Whatever happened to sin? (1 Corinthians 5)</a> and <a href="https://www.faithtoyou.com/titus-21115-kornoff">lessons learned (Titus 2:11-15)</a>.

	<td>Reference discontinuity (part 3/3). 
	<br>Some package manager commands for installing C++ tools included "apt show g++" and "apt show clang". These commands provided a summary for those C++ tools. the description from the commands was not currently saying deprecated or about to be deprecated. If they are being deprecated, having those commands say it might be a way to communicate to some developers who otherwise may not be aware.</td>

	<td>Scope
	<br>The information sheet identifies a plan for the "overarching software community". The information sheet has disclaimer of endorsement at the end. That disclaimer is generic and doesn't identify anything with a scope less than an overarching community. If anything has a smaller scope, identifying that may help readers better grasp any risks.
