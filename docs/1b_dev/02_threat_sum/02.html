<h2>Threat [C/C++ and memory safety]</h2>


<h3>Caesar (Government)</h3>
<p>An <a href="https://sword-2.github.io/sword-wiki/1a_initial/8b_references/8b.html#Caesar">information sheet</a> from Caesar once appeared on the browsers google search start page. Interest occurred in the content because of potential to be able to look at fewer languages. Typical market operation may encourage a bunch of languages and be normal, but it is not easy for some individuals to know a lot of them. The info sheet sheet was trying to steer away from C/C++ and unfortunate for those of us that were doing that language.</p>

<h3>Language considerations</h3>
<p>The comparison may be poor, but separation of software groups can be compared to separation of denominations (C++/Java/swift - Baptist/Methodist/independent). One of the SWORD engines was already in Java, a language the information sheet encouraged. There is no intent to further divide, but one individual coming out of C/C++ may observe the Swift language was newer - if they had to learn a new language, they went for the most recent. This does nothing to prevent software separation, but it just a process. Also, Goal a4-6 was added to identify there is possible language (perl) from a believer. The status of that language is not currently known.</p>

<h3>Perceived challenges</h3>
<p>Challenges could go out of scope of the project. Since safe languages (swift, etc) was partly caused by Caesar, some categories from K-12 were added for options to file content.</p>

	<td>Reference discontinuity (part 1/2).
	<br>In 1998, a document on <a href="https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=114847">software development and documentation (MIL-STD-498 notice 1)</a> was canceled. It handed effort off to IEEE/EIA 12207. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_12207">Wikipedia article</a> for IEEE/EIA 12207 was not observed to comment software memory safety. Also, the works cited in the information sheet did not refer to the IEEE/EIA.</td>

	<td>Collaborating Around Computing</td>
	<td>Goals beyond scope</td>
	<td>a4-6</td>
	<td>The information sheet uses term "malicious actor", where the word "malicious" can be found in the bible. One example is Psalm 36:4 (CSB) Even on his bed he makes malicious plans. He sets himself on a path that is not good and does not reject evil. Some church sermons were put that will encourage turning away from the word and definition malicious. <a href="https://sword-2.github.io/sword-wiki/1a_initial/8b_references/8b.html#church">sin</a>.</td>

	<td>-</td>
	<td>Software Risks not thoroughly identified</td>
	<td>a1-2</td>
	<td>The goal for paper bibles was for the readers who prefer not to experience software anomalies. The information sheet's "disclaimer of endorsement" appeared to skip sub-disclaimers for each recommended language. Operators of the bible app may want to be cautious about any developer trying to introduce new code, cautious of a new risk. There might be a surprise sub-disclaimer that was not foreseen, and if one is able to get into the SWORD project, some readers may opt for a paper bible to avoid the anomaly.</td>
