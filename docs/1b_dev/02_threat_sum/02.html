<h2>Threat [C/C++ and memory safety]</h2>


<h3>Caesar (Government)</h3>
<p>An information sheet on <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Apr/27/2003210083/-1/-1/0/CSI_SOFTWARE_MEMORY_SAFETY_V1.1.PDF">Software Memory Safety</a> once appeared in a web browser default page and was read. Interest occurred because there are many programming languages that can exceed the memory capacity of some people. Anything to limit the quantity may help simplify. Of course, typical market operation may be encouraged to producing as many products as possible thus being overwhelmed could be more normal than simplifying. The info sheet sheet was summarized as preferring certain computer programming languages and migrating away from C/C++.</p>


<h3>Application</h3>
<p>One of the SWORD engines was already in Java, a language the information sheet encouraged. This page gave attention to the Swift language for personal reasons of 1) it was a relatively newer language in the sheet's list and 2) swift advertised backward compatibility to C / C++. An individual who came out of C / C++ and hadn't yet learned Java might investigate the newest language, swift in this case.</p>

<h3>Perceived challenges</h3>
<p>Would using swift be an early plan that was relatively subjective, involved numerous assumptions, and was overly optimistic? This was to be determined. If a challenge was perceived and related to something about Caesar, it was listed below. Perceived challenges more related to the private sector or academics were being moved to another web page on agreements.</p>

	<td>Reference discontinuity (part 1/3).
	<br>In 1998, a document on <a href="https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=114847">software development and documentation (MIL-STD-498 notice 1)</a> was canceled. It handed effort off to IEEE/EIA 12207. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_12207">Wikipedia article</a> for IEEE/EIA 12207 was not observed to comment software memory safety. Also, the works cited in the information sheet did not refer to the IEEE/EIA. If the Wikipedia and information sheet works cite cross-reference, the perception of discontinuity will be less.

	<td>Reference discontinuity (part 2/3).
	<br>Goals for <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/csstandards.pdf">school grades K-12</a> identified network safety, but memory safety was not observed. Including computer memory safety goals for grades K-12 gives a bunch more folks a common sense way to encounter the goal, assuming the information sheet is not the normal way. If someone arrives from the information sheet, there is more complexity like learning if software licenses will prevent military applications <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/199055/open-source-licenses-that-explicitly-prohibit-military-applications">(one blog)</a>. K-12 goals allows folks to separate from the information sheet.
	<br>Discontinuity of references is OK for some people who are not involved in Caesar's global issues. The information sheet's term 'malicious actor' reminds of a the bible word sinner, although the exact definition was not known or looked up in a dictionary. According to Romans 3:23 everyone is a sinner, and some sermons that teach talk about sin and disconnecting from it include <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YkPgUWmRM0k">Whatever happened to sin? (1 Corinthians 5)</a> and <a href="https://www.faithtoyou.com/titus-21115-kornoff">lessons learned (Titus 2:11-15)</a>.

	<td>Reference discontinuity (part 3/3). 
	<br>A communication with the participants in the C / C++ language and tool makers (gcc, g++, clang, etc) was not observed in the information sheet's works cited. Some agreement with them to confirm there are no plans to add in safety later on might encourage those already invested in C  C++ to convert easier. There have been past changes to both the C  C++ language and tools for a while so ruling out a safety change may be reasonable. And if there is confirmation that changes for safety will not happen, are there any people in the C / C++ language and tools to migrate over? An education standard for computer science for K-12 in California teaches about being inclusive. If the inclusiveness can't be done for C / C++ language and tools, will it be done for any of the people in that community?

	<td>Interim period during shift between languages:
	<br>One paragraph began with the sentence "It is not trivial to shift a mature software development infrastructure from one computer language to another." The impression of the information sheet was mostly a future plan for a binary situation with old languages being done and new languages replacing them. Less content was observed for the interim time during a shift. For example, a list of some old programs/languages suitable with priority for a shift was not observed. Caesar might be predicted to focus on internal things - One time an error message was observed for an online catalog to the Library of Congress web interface. The web interface said "Notice: Search and other functions of our website are experiencing technical difficulties. We are working on the problem - thanks for your patience". Was this message insignificant or does it mean there is a software component ready for a shift?
	<br>Caesar's involvement in programs not being directly being used may be less, but a lot of them are estimated to exist. Some priority list would then allow a decision on the feasibility of shifting them as more details may exist. Some of them may be more straightforward to shift and others hard due to minimal documentation and confusing software code.

	<td>Scope
	<br>The information sheet identifies a plan for the "overarching software community". This sounds great since it is simple / not complex without nuances for sub-communities. But is that really the situation or is are there nuances that cause the languages and tools to be less than the "overarching software community"? The information sheet has disclaimer of endorsement at the end. That disclaimer is generic and without nuances. If any are known, identifying them may help readers to have confidence or avoid assumptions that may not work out later.
