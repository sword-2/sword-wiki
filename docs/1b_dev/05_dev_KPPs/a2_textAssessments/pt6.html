<h3 id="6a">Review - King James Version (KJV)</h3>

<p class="border1">
Well, we're now in our 6th week of our study of bible translations. And so far we've covered only 1 translation that is still widely used today. Anybody remember what translation that is? (Student: KJV). The KJV. Of all the translations we covered, that's really the only one that is still popular today, even though its the oldest of all the translations that we've covered in any depth. We did talk about quite a few older English translations, but not really in any depth. Yeah, the KJV is the most popular of the older English translations. It was published in 1611 and it is still popular over 400 years today. It was the top dog for over 300 years in the English speaking world. And for some part of that time, it was the only translation being used, there was nothing else being used. But we did see that there are many problems with the KJV. It has many passages that are not in modern English, of course. They have obsolete or misleading language. The KJV has a variety of misinterpretations, not like the translators were purposely trying to misinterpret the bible, they just did the best they could. And now 400 years later we can see that they got it wrong in various places, they misinterpreted the text. There are several passages, especially in the new testament that are based on very poor manuscript evidence. The copies of the new testament were not consulted thoroughly back in those days. Many of them weren't discovered yet, many of these old copies weren't available for consultation. But since then many discoveries have been made. Many manuscripts have been discovered and so the new testament in the KJV is not very reliable because it's not based on the best available evidence today. And thankfully there were more translations then that appeared on the scene to overcome this problem, because I don't think we can really recommend the KJV as a primary translation. Sure you can consult it and look at it, but it is going to be wrong in quite a few different places. And so it's better to have other translations that we can put a stronger dependence on.
	And the 1st noteworthy translation the appeared to try to overcome some of the deficiencies in the KJV was the ASV. There was one before that, but it was really more of a British translation, so we can just ignore that translation. The ASV was published in 1901 and it had much better manuscript evidence behind it. The translators were able to consult many manuscripts that had been discovered recently, some of them very old manuscripts. And so they were able to fix a lot of the problems in the KJV.  Unfortunately though, the ASV was just as difficult to read as the KJV because they didn't really put it into modern English. They just kept using all sorts of archaic language that was in the KJV including all sorts of archaic pronouns that we don't use any more like thou and thee and ye and those sorts of words.

</p>


<h3 id="6b">Revised Standard Version</h3>


<p class="border1">
And so about 50 years later there was a revision of the ASV that's called the RSV. And this was a much more readable translation then the KJV or the ASV. It did remove most of the archaic pronouns, not all them, they did keep archaic pronouns when ever the language is directed toward God. So that happened a lot in the Psalms, for example. The Psalmists are writing directly toward God, they're speaking to God. And so the translators of the RSV kept those old archaic pronouns when ever the writers of scripture were speaking directly to God. That's not really the biggest issue though with the RSV. That's more of a minor issue, its a readability issue.
	The biggest problem with the RSV is that has some really serious theological problems. And so we looked at these last week. We saw that in Genesis for an example, there is a contradiction between chapter 9 and then some of the earlier chapters. Chapter 9 says that Noah was the first tiller of the soil, but earlier in Genesis we could already see that Adam tilled the soil and so did Cain. And so that is just a flat out contradiction. The RSV is promoting a very low view of scripture that accepts errors in the bible.
	In the book of Matthew the RSV says that a virgin would conceive referring to Mary and the virgin birth of Christ. And it's quoting from the book of Isaiah, but in the RSV the book of Isaiah doesn't use the word virgin, it has the phrase young woman. And so the RSV basically is implying to us that Matthew did not quote the old testament accurately. He was just changing the old testament to suit his purposes. And so he was kind of making this prophecy up, he was saying - oh yeah, there's this prophecy back here. But the RSV is saying no not really, Matthew just kind of faked this here and there wasn't really this prophecy about a virgin birth. And so the RSV is once again giving us a low view of scripture, and a low view of Christ as well.
	In the book of Romans there is a verse in chapter 9 that teaches the deity of Christ, at least in most bible translations. And that seems to be the best way to interpret that text. But the RSV misinterprets that verse so that it does not teach the deity of Christ. And I think what's going on there is the translators were keen to minimize this doctrine and to avoid it wherever they could, because they don't have a high view of Jesus.
	In 1 John there's a verse where the RSV has the word expiation instead of the word propitiation which was used in the ASV and the KJV. The translators did not like the concept of God's wrath. Propitiation has to do with turning away God's wrath. Expiation just just has to do with the removal of sin. So they were kind of toning down the doctrine of the atonement here. And they were sort of minimizing the doctrine of salvation and changing it so that it was not accurate. And it wasn't just in 1 John, we see this happen in several other places as well. I think the word propitiation is used 6 or 7 times in the ASV and all of them have been changed to expiation in the RSV.
	So the RSV is weak doctrinally. Its weak on the doctrine of scripture, weak on the doctrine of Christ, and weak on the doctrine of salvation. And that is why conservative bible believing Christians did not accept the RSV. They rejected it and they criticized it strongly. You can go back and you can read articles that conservative bible scholars wrote back in the 50s. And they just blasted this translation, they criticized it very strongly.

<h3 id="6c">New American Standard Bible (NASB) - 1977, 1995</h3>

<p class="border1">
And so obviously it was time for a new bible translation to come out. If the RSV was deficient, hey, let's come up with something else. And so in 1971 a new revision of the ASV was published. It's called the NASB. And this translation thankfully avoids all of those different theological problems that I just mentioned. Now the translators of the NASB did decide to follow the lead of the RSV in one way, not in the area theology, but they did decide to use archaic pronouns whenever God is being addressed. So they didn't use archaic language throughout the bible, but just in those places where the words are being addressed to God. So they're just doing the same exact thing that the RSV translators did. This is true about the original edition of the NASB in 1971 and then when the translation was revived a few years later in 1977, they kept that as well, they kept the archaic pronouns when ever the words are directed to God. And so there are plenty of verses in the 1977 edition of the NASB that are just not very readable. You come to them and try to read them, and it's just hard to get a good sense of what's going on. And the NASB is already hard enough to read just because it's a very literal translation. And so the language is [harder to read], people have criticized it - long sentences, you know, difficult words sometimes. But you throw in these all these archaic pronouns as well and then some of these verses are really tough to read.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt6, '06:20', '07:50')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Thankfully though the publisher of the NASB decided to do something about this issue. It got criticized a lot for this particular problem. And so in 1995 the NASB was revised once again. So this is the 2nd major revision, the 1st was in 1977 and now 18 years later there's another revision of the NASB here in 1995. And in this version of the NASB all of those archaic pronouns are now gone. They are removed. There's not a single archaic pronoun used in the 1995 edition of the NASB. All those pronouns have been converted into modern English pronouns.

Let's look at some examples here. We'll just review the examples that we looked at last week starting with Deuteronomy 3:24. First we'll look at the 1977 edition of the NASB, which we read last week, just by way of review, and then I'll show you the 1995 edition of the NASB, where you can see how that changed. Alright here's what the 77 NASB says [verse read]. So as you might remember, this was 1 of the verses we looked at that's full of these archaic pronouns. We have the word thy there several times, we have the word thine at the end, and then there are also some kind of archaic verbs there as well that go with the archaic pronounced, thou hast. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt6, '08:33', '09:22')">audio</a>
</p>



<!-- remove technical difficulty: And where was the other one there, I thought there was another archaic verb. Nope, I think that's the only one in there. -->



<p class="border1">
So there's at least 5 archaic words in there that I can see, most of them being pronouns. Now let's see what the NASB 1995 says in this verse [verse read]. Ahhhh, does not sound so much nicer to read here in modern English in the in the 21st century? This is much more readable than that 1977 edition of the NASB here. No more archaic pronouns or verbs, its in pretty smooth English here. OK, it is a long sentence, they use a semicolon there in the middle instead of a period. They don't start a new sentence. And so it kind of goes on a bit here, but at least all the words there are pretty understandable here. Notice that the pronouns referring to God are still capitalized though. They've been changed to modern English pronouns, but the NASB publisher decided to keep capitalizing pronouns that refer to God. And I did mention that I'm not a huge fan of that last week. I think that does raise some different issues that come up. Sometimes we don't know if the pronoun is referring to God or not, there's actually some ambiguity in the original text. Sometimes the NASB capitalizes pronouns even though the Pharisees are speaking about Jesus, and they don't believe Jesus is God, so the capitalized pronoun can be a little bit misleading there. This is not a huge deal I don't think, but it is I believe a minor flaw in the NASB.

</table>



<p class="border1">
Let's look now at Psalm 76:7, another verse that we looked at last week. Here's what the 1977 NASB says [verse read]. Once again you can see this verse is littered with archaic pronouns - thou 3 times, thy once, and then we have an archaic verb there used twice, art instead of are. Modern readers, they're going to see that word art, and they're going to think are they talking about an art class here, what's going on? So this is gonna be very confusing and misleading.
So thankfully in the 1995 NASB we have modern English [verse read]. So this is much more readable here. The pronouns are still capitalized there even though they're different pronouns, but they're still capitalized because that's what the NASB publisher decided to do.
	Notice that there is another word here though, not a pronoun, that is capitalized even though we probably wouldn't think it should be capitalized. Do you see what word that is? It's capitalized in both editions. What word is capitalized here that's not a pronoun? (Student: and). And, isn't that interesting. That's not at the beginning of a sentence, there's a semi colon there. There is no new sentence here and yet they're capitalizing the word and. What is going on here? Well the NASB translators decided to follow tradition here, this is poetry, and they've set it in poetry in the bible. I haven't preserved the lines of poetry here on the screen, I could have done that I guess, because I think it would fit on the screen, but I didn't. So anyway the word and is beginning a new line of poetry, and it's tradition in English language to start each new line of poetry with a capital letter. That practice has not really continued today. Most poets don't do that, they don't capitalize the first word in a new line. And so there is no other bible translation I know of that does this, that capitalizes words that begin a new line of poetry. I think the NASB is the only one who does it. So it's a little bit jarring to see this here, its just a little bit weird to see it, especially if you're just giving running text and you're not following the lines of poetry. So if you were quoting it in a paper and you just spit out the words in order like I've done here, its going to look a little bit funny. So its not a huge issue once again, but I think it's a bit of a little minor problem, one that I think it would have been good for them to just put that into lower case and follow the direction where the English language is going here with not capitalizing those words anymore.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at one more verse here that we looked at last week, John 17:6, the 77 NASB says [verse read]. So even in the new testament this practice is still followed where we have archaic pronouns that are talking about God here. Jesus is praying to his father, so these pronouns, most of them are referring to God the father. There are 2 pronouns - Me - that refer to Jesus, and those are also capitalized as well. But the archaic pronouns are the ones referring to God the father there - Thy, Thou, Thine. Are there any archaic verbs here? Yes, gavest, gavest. So that's a little bit of a problem as well there, that there's archaic verbs to go with archaic pronouns. And so again this is just not very readable. We need an update, and 95 NASB comes the rescue [verse read]. So as you can see, once again, all these archaic pronouns and those archaic verbs, they are gone. They have been put into modern English. And so the 1995 NASB is considerably more readable than the 1977 NASB. Not in every verse, of course, but all the verses where the language is directed toward God, those verses are much easier to read in the 1995 edition of the NASB.

<p class="border1">
Unfortunately though, some of the changes that were made to the 95 NASB were questionable. I don't think any of these changes are really serious problems, we're not talking about stuff that's on the level of the RSV, theological problems and that sort of thing. But they did make some changes moving from the 77 NASB to the 95 that I think aren't so good. I want to show you are a couple of these.

</table>

<p class="border1">
Let's take a look at Mark 14:45-46. And once again we'll start with the 1977 NASB and I'll show you what got changed moving to the 95 NASB. So here's what the 77 edition says [verse read]. Alright, we don't have any names here so let's try to figure out who these pronouns are referring to. We have the pronoun he at the very beginning there, and then we have the pronoun him. Notice its capitalized so that's giving us a clue as to what translators think about that pronoun. Who is that pronoun referring to? (Students: Jesus). That's referring to Jesus, the pronoun Him. And we actually have the pronoun Him 4 times and they're all capitalized. So those are all referring to Jesus.
	What about that 1st pronoun though, he,who do we think that's referring to? (Students: Judas). That's referring to Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Jesus. Yes, but this is a very literal translation from the original Greek, there are no names in this verse, just pronouns. So the NASB in 77 gave us a good literal translation of this. 
	Now let's take a look at the 1995 NASB [verse read]. Now what has changed here? There's a couple different changes here in the 95 NASB, what are they? The word Judas has been inserted. The word Judas does not appear in the original text. The translators said - we better put a name in there just to clarify. That really wasn't necessary because just 2 verses earlier we have the word Judas in the text. And as people are reading this verse in context, these 2 verses, they're going to understand - oh yeah, that's Judas, he was just mentioned. So I don't think this was really necessary. It's not necessarily bad, but its not a very literal translation because the name Judas does not appear here in the original Greek. So that's one of the changes.
	What is the other change, or there's actually 2 more changes that are exactly the same? (Student: the word and). The word and. In the 77 NASB both of these sentences here, one in verse 45 and one in verse 46, both of these start with the word and. In the 95 NASB the word and has been removed. Why do you think translators did that? Why did they remove the word and? I already told you the 77 NASB is literal, there is a Greek word at the beginning of each sentence that can mean and. So why do you think that translators would say we don't want that word here, let's get rid of it? Have you guys been trained one writing proper English. Yeah, if you've been trained in writing proper English, you been told - don't start too many sentences with the word and. That is something to use only sparingly. So to have 2 sentences back to back that start with the word and, that does not really follow modern English style right? But by removing the word and we've reduced the value of this translation as a good bible study tool because there is a Greek word that means and at the beginning of both of these verses. If you're doing a careful study of scripture you wanna know about things like this, you wanna know are there conjunctions here and how do they function? Well, the conjunctions here are just showing that the sentences are closely linked. You know this happened, and then this happened right afterwards, and this happened right afterwards. It is very common in ancient Greek to start sentences with conjunctions. Whether its a conjunction that means and, or a conjunction that means for, or a conjunction that means but, or conjunction that means therefore. Most sentences do start with a conjunction. So if we do want to have a good literal translation that will reveal those conjunctions to us, we really do need to have those conjunctions there in English as well. And so this is an example of how the NASB is not as literal in the 95 edition compared to the 1977 edition. They're trying to make it more readable, but in doing so, they are making the translation a little bit less literal as well.

<p class="border1">
Let me show you another example of a questionable change in the 95 NASB. Look at Luke 1:41 in the 77 NASB [verse read]. Who's the baby here? (Student: Jesus). That' Jesus, right - sorry, the baby in Mary's womb is Jesus. We're talking about the baby in Elizabeth's womb. Who is that? John the baptist, right. Now let's look at this verse in the updated NASB, the 1995 edition [verse read]. Alright, what has changed here? What has been removed and 95 NASB? It's shorter right, you can kind of see it's not as long. So what has been deleted? (Student: and it came about). And it came about that. The first 5 words have been deleted here in the 1995 NASB. This is representing 2 words in the original Greek, a word that means and, and as we've already seen, the 95 NASB doesn't like to start sentences with the word and. Then there's another word translated, it came about that. And if you were to do a search in the 77 NASB, for just 3 words there, it came about, sometimes the word that is used, sometimes the word when is used. Other words are sometimes put there also, but that phrase, it came about, that is used 411 times in the 77 edition of the NASB. But in the 1995 edition of the NASB its only used a 185 times, and you won't find it anywhere in the new testament, even though the use of the 50 times or so and the 77 edition. And so what the NASB is doing here is just trying to smooth this out a little bit and remove what they feel is kind of superfluous language here. They didn't just take and out, but they even took the next phrase out as well. But again, this is coming from the Greek text. This is a literal translation here. The word here in the original text is used in narrative material to sort of push the story along. It's sort of marking - okay, we're transitioning to a new aspect of this story now. It brings a little bit of emphasis to the story. And so the 95 NASB is not communicating that aspect of the story here from the original text. The 77 NASB is more literal here and is a better bible study tool that the 95 NASB at least in this verse and all the other verses where there is this difference, where the 95 NASB is deleting that phrase.

<p class="border1">
Now let me show you 1 more example of a questionable change in the 95 NASB. Let's look at 1 Peter 3:7a. And this is a long verse, so I decided to skip over the second half of the verse. The first half of the verse is what I want to focus on. So look at what it say here in the 77 NASB [verse read]. Now look at the updated NASB of 1995 [verse read]. Now what has changed here? There are 2 changes here in the 95 NASB, can you spot them? (Student: likewise). Likewise, yeah, likewise in the 77 NASB has been changed to this phrase in the same way. That change I think is fine, cause likewise just basically means in the same way. And in the same way is more readable English, so I think that's a good change, its a way to make the translation more readable without sacrificing the fact that it is literal.
	The other change here is more problematic. Do you see the other change? (Student: vessel). Vessel, the word vessel is there in the 77 NASB and that's a very literal translation, there's a Greek word here that means vessel. Sometimes it used literally, not here of course its a reference to a person, to a woman, to the wife of a husband, but in other verses it might be used more literally to refer to a cup or a pot or something like that. And so in the 95 NASB they've said - oh, this is kind of confusing language here, let's make this more readable and we'll just say with someone weaker. But we have lost the image here that Peter was trying to communicate here with the word vessel. Peter wanted us to imagine the woman as a vessel here. It's figurative language and so the NASB of 95 is not as literal here as the 77 NASB.
	Notice one other feature here that we've observed in the past. There are words in italics here, right. Do you remember what the italics communicate in the NASB? (Student: words added). Words that have been added that don't come directly from the original text, but they're implied. And isn't that the case here? If you took out that phrase your wives, it would be begging to have it added, right, cause it wouldn't make any sense to not have it there. But that phrase does not come directly from the Greek text. Peter just kind of left it out because - I guess he was lazy, I don't know. He just assumed his readers would understand what is meant there, and the phrase didn't have to be put there. The previous 6 verses were addressed to wives so I think the context kind of makes it obvious. Peter switching from wives to husbands and he's talking about husbands relating to their wives. But I like that the NASB is alerting us to the fact that in the original text that phrase your wives is not actually there. I don't like that they're putting it in italics, because italics convey emphasis in modern English and that's the opposite of what the NASB translators are trying to convey. So I suggested brackets would be better here. Brackets would convey the idea that hey were inserting these. We use brackets any time we add words to a quote for example, cause we don't want to tamper with a quote and say that I'm changing it without alerting us to that. So put words in brackets if you want to add words to a quote and then people will know that. So that would work really well here too. So I like the idea, I just don't like the way they carried it out with the italics here.

</p>

<p class="border1">
Student: So what would it say, live with? Yeah, live with in an understand way, that's a very literal translation. And so Peter just left out the mention of the wives cause I think he just thought - this is obvious I don't have to throw it in there. This is a sort of a common thing in Greek, to leave out words that were obvious. They would not always do that, but they would sometimes do that. I doubt it was laziness, it might have been - hey, I don't wanna have to use a really long scroll, let me try to abbreviate this a little bit and save some money, cause writing materials were expensive back in those days.

<p class="border1">
So my analysis of the 1995 NASB is that it is a significant improvement on the 1977 NASB. It is considerably more readable especially where all those archaic pronouns were used. But then there are other places where they made it more readable where I think it might not be appropriate to do that because they're also making it less literal. And that's one of the features of the NASB, it's a very literal translation. So moving it away from being literal may not be a step in the right direction there.

<h3 id="6d">NASB - 2020</h3>


<p class="border1">
However, the 95 NASB is not the current edition of this translation. This is the one that I grew up using. I didn't start using the NASB I think until the late 90s, so this is what I used. I never use the 77 NASB, I'm not old enough for that. But now the 95 NASB is the older version, it's not the the newest version of this translation. Just a few years ago in the year 2020 the NASB was revised again. And most of the changes made in the 2020 edition of the NASB we're good. I've spent quite a bit of time just browsing through the changes. Somebody put together a website where they kept track of all the changes made from the 95 NASB to the 2020 NASB. And so you can actually scan through them and get a good handle if you just take an hour or 2. You wouldn't be able to get through the whole new testament, but I looked at probably 6 or 7 books of the bible, just to kind of scan through changes and I liked a lot of what I was seeing there.

<p class="border1">
So let me show you some of the examples of improvements that have been made in the updated version of the NASB from 2020. Let's start in the old testament with Psalm 1:1. Here is the 95 NASB [verse read]. Now let me show you the 2020 NASB [verse read]. What has changed here in the 2020 edition? You should be able to see something right away. (Students: how). The word how has been removed. That's totally fine, there is no Hebrew word that means how here. They're taking the word for blessed and saying - well, let's emphasize this a little more with the word how. But in 2020 they said - we should probably just delete this word and go with just the word blessed. I approve of that change, I think that's a good change, its slightly more literal now.
	What else has changed here? (Student: man). Yes, the word man, blessed is the man, is now more gender neutral, blessed is the person. The Hebrew word here can refer to a male, a person of the male gender, but not always. A lot of times it just refers to anybody, any person of any gender here. And so this is a more gender sensitive translation here, it's an appropriate change. Some bible translations have made too many changes in this regard, I don't think the NASB has done that. They have made appropriate changes, because I think obviously the Psalmist is not just talking about a man here, he's talking about any person. So the word person I think is a very good translation from the original Hebrew here.

And we'll see other examples of the NASB making appropriate gender changes. I'll show you a few more examples in other ways where this has been improved.
	Notice by the way that they continue to use the word nor in the 2020 NASB. When was the last time you used the word nor? That word is not used very much in modern English. This would have been a good opportunity for them to replace the word nor with a different word. What word would you put here if you were saying this? (Student: or). Or, just take of the letter n and say or instead. This is the more modern English way of speaking and it fits perfectly here. There are still places where nor can be used where or can't be, but they overlap a lot. And here I think they overlap. And we could use the word or here, I guess maybe we can suggest this for the next edition of the NASB. Hey, why don't you get rid of the word nor here and put the word or there instead. That would make it flow even more smoothly here and improve the translation some more. So I wish they would have made additional changes to this verse, but I do like the changes that were made. Notice they do continue capitalize the first word in lines of poetry, the word nor is beginning a new line of poetry in each case. And they're continuing to capitalize that word, another thing that I think they should probably change as well. Oh well, its not a perfect translation. I don't like everything about it, but I do like the changes that they did make.

question. (Student: oh, I was going to ask about the capitalization ...)  Yeah, that's whats going on, its a new line of poetry, and they're just continuing that practice in the updated NASB here.

<p class="border1">
So lets look now at another verse in the Psalms, Psalm 37:1. Here's the 95 NASB [verse read]. Now look at the 2020 NASB [verse read]. Alright, what's changed here? Couple changes. (Student: fret). Fret is not a word often used, its kind of an older English word, so I like the change here. They used the word upset instead and actually, if you're familiar with the word fret, when you think of the word fret, what comes to mind? What idea? (Student: fear). Fear, worry, anxiety, right, that's kind of what fret means. The word upset doesn't really convey that, it has to do more with anger, and this is actually the idea of the original Hebrew text here. The Hebrew text has a word here that usually refers to anger. So not only do we have a more modern English word, but a more accurate English word here as well. This is a very good change to the NASB, I approve of this change.
	What else changed here? There's something in the second half of the verse that also changed. (Student: Be not). Be not envious. That is not normal modern English there. Modern English would be to say do not be envious. And notice that is exactly the type of language we have at the beginning of the verse - do not fret. And so its weird that in the second half of the verse they would switch and instead of saying do not like we have the beginning of the verse, they go with be not envious. This is something that's puzzled me for quite a few years. I noticed it and I thought, wow, this is strange, they're being very inconsistent here. Modern English and then kind of older English. So I was very glad when I looked at the 2020 NASB to see that they fixed this. This is something I noticed probably 10-15 years ago in the 95 NASB. And so when the 2020 NASB came out, and I looked for this, I said Ahhh, that's good. They have it in modern English all the way through the verse now - do not get upset, do you not be envious of wrongdoers. So this is more readable then the 1995 NASB. I like the changes that they made here.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at one more verse in the Psalms. Psalm 38:21. Here's the 95 NASB [verse read]. Here's the 2020 NASB [verse read]. What changes are made here? (Students: O LORD). O LORD has been changed to LORD. And then the very next phrase has something similar right? O my God changes to My God. The word O has been deleted both times. Why do you think that's happened? When was the last time you addressed somebody with the word O in front of their name? Probably never, right. That is older English, nobody says that anymore, nobody uses the word O before a personal address. So this is an example of changing into modern English. And it's also more literal because there is no word that means O in the original text here. That word was just added to sort of convey solemness and adding a personal dimension to this here, but it doesn't have any basis in the original text. So this is the good change both based on readability and also on literalness here.
	What also changed here? (Student: forsake). Forsake has been changed to abandon. This is a very minor change, I think forsake and abandon would be viewed as synonyms here. And so it wasn't really necessary to make this change, but I suspect the translators thought the word abandon is a little bit more modern English than forsake. I think people still use the word forsake, but maybe not as often as the word abandon. So if this is an improvement in readability, it is only a very slight improvement. So not a bad change, probably not necessary, but they made it and it probably helps a little bit.

<p class="border1">
Let's move now over into the new testament starting with the book of Matthew. We're going to look at several examples from our first gospel here. Let's start with Matthew 6:13. Here is the 95 NASB [verse read]. Now look at the 2020 NASB [verse read].
	This one should be obvious, what changed here? (Student mentioned something). That whole 2nd half of the verse is gone. All those words in brackets have disappeared. What's going on here is, in the 95 NASB, whenever there is material of a decent length, like a half verse or longer, and those words do not come from the oldest copies of the new testament, instead of deleting it from the text, they would just put brackets around instead to sort of indicate - hey, this probably wasn't in the original manuscript. That is probably wasn't what Jesus said, this was what Matthew wrote down here, the Lord's prayer did not end with these words. That's what the translators are saying to us. And yet if people don't understand what the brackets mean, then they're just gong to read it and assume this is what Jesus said, this is what Matthew wrote.
	So I like this change in the 2020 NASB. They just took the words out of the text and they dropped them into a footnote instead. I didn't show you the footnote, but basically the same words are just sitting in a footnote instead. And so is removing it from the text and putting it into a more insignificant place, where it belongs because it's very unlikely that Matthew wrote this. Otherwise we would expect to see this in the oldest manuscripts, the oldest copies of the new testament. It's just not there, it didn't come along until later. And so that's why its in the KJV because the KJV is not based on the oldest copies of the new testament, but in the ASV they didn't put it here. The RSV, the NASB - the NASB didn't handle this very well, they put it in brackets, they should have taken it out and just put it in a foot note. But at least they have fixed that now. And this example could be multiplied, I could show you at least another dozen examples where they've put words in brackets in the 95 NASB and then taken them out and put them in to a footnote in the 2020 NASB. This is a good improvement here, I agree with this change.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at another verse in Matthew 10:37. Here's the 95 NASB [verse read]. Who's is speaking here? (Students: Jesus). Jesus. That word 'Me' is capitalized there to reflect that, to reflect the fact that Jesus is referring to himself, stressing the fact that he's God. Let's look at the 2020 NASB [verse read]. Not much has changed here, but there is a little change that has happened twice. The same change 2 different places, can you spot it? (Student: he). The word he has changed to the phrase - the one. And this is another example of updating the gender language in the NASB. Taking masculine language that really doesn't belong there, there's nothing in the original text here to suggest Jesus is only talking about men here. And so the 2020 NASB is appropriately updating this to be more gender neutral now. It can refer to a person either gender. This is a good change here, another example of making the translation more gender sensitive here.
	Notice that we are still seeing capitalized pronouns that refer to God here, just like we were seeing in the older editions of the NASB. So not just capitalized words at the beginning of a line of poetry, but capitalized pronouns referring to God. That is still taking place in the 2020 NASB. Again, I'm not a huge fan of that, but it is what is is, that's what they're doing. So as long as you understand what's going on it shouldn't be a problem.

<p class="border1">
Okay, let's look at 1 more verse from the book of Matthew, Matthew 19:9. Here's the 95 NASB [verse read]. You know who's speaking here? Who would normally be speaking in a gospel? (Student: Jesus). Jesus, right. Yeah this is Jesus talking here. Now let's look at the 2020 NASB [verse read]. What has changed here? I think there is only 1 change here. Yes, only 1 change. What has changed? (Student: sexual). Yes, the 2020 NASB has adding a word here and this is a very important change. This might be the most important update in the 2020 NASB that we're looking at here because the word immorality by itself in modern English just refers to wickedness in general. That is not what Jesus is talking about here. The original Greek word that's found in Matthew's gospel does not refer to wickedness in general. It refers to sexual sin. And so we really do need to add this word sexual here to make it clear. Jesus isn't giving allowance for divorcing your spouse for just any sort of wickedness. Its only a specific type of wickedness that he's talking about here. And so this is a very important change. Somebody could legitimately read the 95 NASB and get the wrong idea and go down the path of sin because they've been misled by the older NASB here. So this is a very important change here that makes it very clear what Jesus is talking about. It makes the translation much more accurate.

<p class="border1">
Let me show you another example of how the 2020 NASB has improved. Let's move on to Mark's gospel. And this is a passage that we've already looked at today, so it should look familiar. Here's the 95 NASB for Mark 14:45-46 [verse read]. Now do you remember the problems in the 95 NASB here? We looked at this just about 15 minutes ago. What happened here? (Students: conjunction, the word he). Yeah, the word and got removed twice and then the word he got changed to Judas. So now let's look at the 2020 NASB and see how its improved [verse read]. So how has the 2020 NASB improved on the 95 NASB? (Student: and). The word and is back. Yes, they have added that that conjunction again at the beginning of each sentence. And that's something that I saw consistently as I kind of scrolled through the gospels. I looked at 3 of the 4 gospels and consistently I saw them adding the word and at the beginning of sentences in the 2020 NASB. So I think basically, they heard some criticisms about the 95 NASB - why did you delete all these conjunctions, we wanna see those there. And they said, we need to restore these here to make this translation more literal. Now they didn't go all the way and restore it back to the 77 NASB, right. They kept the word Judas there for clarification. And that's the more minor problem I think here. I think they could've gone back to the word he here, but they didn't. They left the word Judas. So its not quite as literal as the 77 NASB, but it is more literal than the 95 NASB. And I do approve of the changes here.

<p class="border1">
Let's look now at a new verse that we haven't looked at before. Romans 1:17. Here's what the 95 NASB says [verse read]. This is the key verse to probably Paul's most significant letter, the book of Romans, one of his longest letters, and one that has probably has more doctrine taught than any of his other letters here. And this is the key verse in that letter. Its focused on righteousness. We see that theme throughout this letter. The word it there at the beginning is talking about the gospel. You might know verse 16 - For I am not ashamed of the gospel ... Well the word it here is just referring back to that word gospel and how the gospel reveals the righteousness of God. Let me show you the 2020 NASB now so you can see what changes they've made [verse read]. What are the 2 changes here in the 2020 NASB, can you see them? (Students: righteous one/one). Yeah righteous one instead of righteous man. So here's another example of making the transition more gender sensitive. Notice the word man is in italics. So there isn't even a Greek word here to be translated into the word man. And so we just have to kind of add a word - actually you don't ever really need to, you could say but the righteous will live by faith, and I think that comes across well enough. But adding a word makes it more readable. But don't add the word man, there's no indication here Paul's talking about just men, he's talking about any person here. So that's a very good change to the 2020 NASB, to make it more gender neutral here. 
	What else has changed? It's the next word. (Student: shall). Shall. We have shall in the 95 NASB and will in the 2020 NASB. That change has been made because the word shall is fading from modern English. Most people don't use that word anymore. It was more common 30, 40, 50 years ago. But its just fading away from modern English and it's sort of being consumed by the word will. You know, why do we need to have both shall and will? Don't they have basically the same function? Let's just use the word will. The language is simplifying, that's something we see happen in many languages throughout history, that the languages just simplify. So this is another good change. The word shall occurs almost 4,000 the 95 NASB. In the 2020 NASB, I searched, its used about 2,600 times. So they didn't get rid of all of them, but they took out about 1400 of them, and this is one of those places. I do wish they'd gone further and just got rid of it completely, but they're taking the more gradual approach here. So maybe in the next edition of the NASB in 20 years, then we won't see the word at all and it'll just be the word will instead of the word shall. But this is I think a good improvement here. They could've gone further with it, but at least they did what they did here. And its a better translation for it. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt6, '40:58', '43:45')">audio</a>
</p>




<p class="border1">
Now I want to talk about one other thing here. Well first notice that we do still have italics in the 2020 NASB, they're continuing that practice of italicizing words that don't come from, directly from, the original text, but are only implied. And again I wish they'd use brackets, maybe we can suggest that to them for the next edition - switch from italics to brackets. But they are still telling you when the words don't come from the original text. And I like that they're doing that, just wish they would do it differently.
	But notice there's something else interesting happening with the typeface here. What else do we have here? (Student: caps). Not just words in italics, but we have words in all caps. And actually they're in small caps, I just couldn't put small caps into my software here, it wouldn't let me do that. So if you were to read this in print, you would see small capital letters here instead of all big capital letters. But still, they are using capital letters here. What do capital letters imply when you see them? If somebody sent you a text message or an email or a letter and they wrote in all caps, what would that suggest? (Student: shouting). They're shouting at you, they're screaming at you. And usually you're not going to take that very well - stop shouting at me, don't yell at me, right. It kind of makes you recoil from that, right. Is that what we should be thinking here when we read this? No, that's not what the translators want, they don't want you to recoil from this. They want you to kind of lock in on it and say whoah, this is really significant. They're trying to emphasize this. What do you think they're emphasizing? What is the thing that they're trying to call your attention to? As it is written. Well where is this written? In the old testament. Yeah, this comes from the book of Habakkak 2:4, this is a quote from the old testament. Every time the NASB has a quote in the new testament from the old testament, they put that quotation in all capital letters. That has been true since the earliest versions of the NASB and they're continuing it all the way until today. Once again though, I don't approve of their methods. Its fine I think to make an old testament quote stand out, but use italics, use bold, use something that conveys more emphasis. If you used all caps its going to seem like its shouting and people are going to recoil from that instead of walking in and saying this is important here, I should pay close attention to this. Actually my preference would be just not to add any emphasis at all cause there's no emphasis in the original text, it just says as it is written, and then it goes on with the quotation. So it's not putting the letters in all caps in the original text, its not making them italicized or bold or anything like that, it's just putting the words there. So the best way I think to translate here would just simply be to put these words in a regular font, lower case letters with capitalized letters as appropriate and not add any emphasis.  You already have quotation marks to show that this is a quote from the old testament. That's probably enough right? Some old translations didn't even use quotes - the KJV didn't use quotes. The ASV didn't use any quotation marks. They would just introduce a quote and then give you the quote without the quotation marks. I don't think that we have to go that far. Yes, there are no quotation marks in the original text, but there are also no commas, and no periods, and no question marks either. They didn't use any punctuation in the old manuscripts. And yet we wouldn't do that in our modern translations. We're going to add punctuation to make it more readable. We can do the same thing with quotation marks too, I think that's appropriate.

</p>

<p class="border1">
Question. Can we eliminate the 2 dots, the colon, and put a comma? Semi-colons are fine. Yeah, I think this is a good place for a semi-colon. Most writers don't use a lot of semi-colons. And that's a shame, I think the semi-colon is a powerful punctuation mark. It implies a stronger connection than the period between two clauses. So I like that the NASB uses a lot of semi-colons. But more readable translations tend not to do that because it makes for shorter sentences if you use periods instead, makes it a little bit more readable. But the NASB's not striving for the ultimate readability there, they're trying to have a literal translation so I think that's fine to do that.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at another letter from Paul, 1 Corinthians chapter 7, if you've been with me in Sunday school we just covered this verse about 2 months ago, 1 Corinthians 7:36. Here's the 95 NASB [verse read]. Here is what the 2020 NASB does with this verse [verse read]. Now there are quite a few different changes here. So I don't know if we'll be able to talk about all of them, but let's try at least to find the most significant change here. There is a very significant change here that's taken place in the 2020 NASB, can you find it? If you find another change that's fine. (Student: unbecomingly and dishonorably). Yeah, unbecomingly has been changed to dishonorably, its a more readable word right? And they have basically the same meaning I think.
	(Student: daughter). Daughter. That is the significant change here. In the 95 NASB, the word daughter has been added. It does not come from the original text, its in italics to show that. In the 2020 NASB they have taken it out.
	Other changes here would be he does not sin instead of he is not sinning. That's a very slight change. The word ought here is used in the 2020 NASB instead of the word must. That's a good change. The original Greek text has a word that means obligation here, has to be with obligations, so ought conveys that well.
	The other important change here is at the very end. It says let them marry instead of let [her] marry. The verb there for marry in the original Greek is 3rd person plural not 3rd person singular. So them is the more literal accurate translation here.
	But let's talk about the word daughter, why has that been removed? Well in [the] past, older scholars thought that Paul was talking about a father here giving away his daughter in marriage. But the scholars of today, modern bible scholars, have reversed position on that. They don't think it refers to a father anymore, but instead to a fiance. It's probably talking about a man who is engaged to be married to a virgin. And the context argues strongly for that. When we went through this passage, we could see that this whole passage, verses 25-40, is focused on a man who was engaged to a virgin. So it would be really weird for Paul to insert a reference to a father here, that would just come out of no where. This text makes more sense if we interpret it as referring to a man who was engaged to be married. And so the NASB is reflecting that change, the consensus of scholarship. It's not complete consensus, but its strong consensus. Most modern scholars, conservative scholars especially, they believe this refers to an engaged couple here. And so taking out the word daughter is appropriate, we don't want to mislead people into thinking this is talking about father, when it probably isn't, right. Take that out and the changing the word her to the word them at the end I think also fits well with this. Its another argument that this is referring to an engaged couple and not just to a father giving away his daughter. This is a very good change in the 2020 NASB, I approve of this.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at James 1:19. Here's the 95 NASB [verse read].
This is the verse, a very important verse, that we all need to get down, right. Especially if we like to talk. Lets be slow to speak and quick to hear instead, if we just talk up a storm when we're around our friends and our family and co-workers, you know, we're kind of going against what James's is saying here. Let's learn to be good listeners and maybe not speak quite as much. And its good to be slow to anger. Scripture teaches God gets angry but he's slow to anger, he's patient. We need to be slow to anger as well, we should not fly off the handle so easily. Anger is appropriate when its righteous anger. We shouldn't let the sun go down on our anger as Paul says in Ephesians. But it is appropriate at times to be angry for the right reasons, but let's be slow to get angry, don't rush headlong into anger. That's not the part of the verse I want to focus on, but there's just some good application there, right, its a powerful statement.
	Look at the 2020 NASB and look at what's changed [verse read]. So the 2nd half of the verse is the same. What's changed in the first half here? The word this is in a new location notice. Instead of this you know, it says you know this. Which order is more modern English? Do we go direct object, subject, verb or do we go subject, verb, direct object? Subject, verb, direct object unless you want to copy Yoda right: Rhrhrh - this you know? That's the way Yoda would say this sentence, but most of us wouldn't talk that way, we would say you know this. The word this is in italics, there is no Greek word for this here, but it smooths it out right? If you just said you know my brothers and sisters, well you know what? So the word this has been added for clarification, talking about knowing something in particular. And he' probably referring back to the previous verse. He just talked about regeneration and the new birth in verse 18. And then he tells his readers - you guys know about this, you know, 'cause you've been saved. You know what it's like to be regenerated. And that's all he's saying there and this is a more appropriate way to convey this in the modern English.
	What else is changed? (Student: brethren). The word brethren has changed to brothers and sisters. This is perhaps the most prevalent change to the NASB, the one that has received the most attention. In the 95 NASB they used the word brethren all over the place to refer to a mixed group Christians, brothers and sisters in Christ. That word brethren just does not really get used in modern English, and so no other translation I know of has it, any modern translation. So the 2020 NASB is trying to use modern English, and they give us the phrase brothers and sisters. And notice the phrase <i>and sisters</i> is in italics, because there is no separate word for sisters here. There's just one word and it can mean just brothers, but when its in the plural like it is here, it often refers to both brothers and sisters, to both men and women who are fellow believers, not literally, flesh and blood brothers and sisters. This is referring to the church and to spiritual brothers and sisters. So this is a very good change, I'm glad they're taking a gender neutral approach here, this is appropriate. But they're putting that phrase <i>and sisters</i> in italics to show you - hey, there is no Greek word here that means sisters, its just implied by the Greek word for brothers. That word is implying that James is talking about both men and women. And like I mentioned earlier, this is a phrase that appears throughout the new testament especially in the different letters that Paul wrote, and Peter, James, and John. They use this Greek word for brothers constantly to refer to their readers, so we see it probably a good 40-50 times, and a NASB is consistently taking it now as brothers and sisters, which is a very good change.
	Notice the next word is also changed, the word now has replaced the word but, and I think the translators just realized - hey, there's not really a contrast going on here. The Greek conjunction here is flexible, it can sometimes just introduce a new section. And the word now is kind of way that we might transition to new material. I think that's all that's going on, James's is transitioning to a new subject, from regeneration to now making sure that we are quick to hear. And he goes on a few verses to say we need to be doers of the word not just hearers. So he's not saying just listen, but then also put into practice what you learn when you hear God's word.

<table border=1><caption>1 John 3:6</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 1995</td><td>No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him.</td></tr>

<p class="border1">
	Let's look at 1 more example of a good change in the 2020 NASB - 1 John 3:6. Look at the 95 NASB [verse read]. I hope that that statement is kind of jarring  and is troubling to you. It sounds like if you are Christian, you don't sin any more, right? And is that what John means here? Well it can't be, because just 2 chapters earlier in the 1 John chapter 1:8 he said that that we're deceiving ourselves if we [say we] have no sin. So that cannot be what John means here. He's not saying that once we become Christians were perfect and we don't sin anymore. And so the 2020 NASB has made an appropriate change here [verse read]. There's another change here as well, do you see the other change besides the word continually? What other word has changed here? (Student: remains). Remains, yes. The word abides, while a favorite word among Christians, especially if you grew up on the KJV, it is not a word used very often in modern English. So they've changed this to a more modern English word - remains. And that's exactly what the Greek word means here, it means to remain. And that's what the word abide means if you understand what it means, at least, it just means to remain in him, in Jesus, that's what it is talking about. So a good change.
	And they've added this word continually twice. This is not coming from a specific Greek word here, there is no Greek word that means continually. Instead, this is a nuance that is often a part of a present tense verb in Greek. The present tense verb in Greek often conveys an ongoing action. And that is probably the best way to interpret what John is saying here. He's not talking about sinning at all, he's talking about a continual practice of sin. When we get saved we are new creations now and we're no longer slaves to sin anymore, sinning constantly left and right. Instead, we are new creations, and we have a new nature, and instead of sinning constantly, were growing in Christ now - putting sin off. We do still sin, but that is not what marks us as Christians. We're marked by putting off sin and by following Christ and living in obedience to him. So this I think is a very helpful clarification. I'm glad they put the word in italics here, brackets would've been better, but they marked it off some way to show - hey, for those of you wanna know, if you want to study this carefully, there is no Greek word here that means continually, they're adding the word because they think that this is the best way to interpret the verse. And they don't want to mislead people into thinking that they're not saved. Well I still sin, I must not be saved. John wrote his letter for the opposite reason, he was trying to give assurance of salvation to true believers. So he would would not want true believers to come away thinking: Well, I'm not really saved here. He would want false converts, people who've made a false profession of faith to think that. And if they are sinning continually, they really should stop and examine themselves to see if they're in the faith.

<h3 id="6e">NASB 2020 recommendation</h3>

<p class="border1">
So I'm happy to be able to recommend the NASB. Yeah, you could probably go find these older editions online, you could probably buy the 1995 NASB if you looked hard enough for it in a bookstore online somewhere. But the 2020 NASB is the current edition, this is what you're gonna find if you search for it. I do think this is the best edition of the NASB. Every edition of the NASB has improved and gotten better and better. And so I can gladly recommend the NASB to you. This is the 1st translation I can recommend for your use today, and they'll be many others, but this is the first one. I do think this is one of the very best bible translations available in the English language today. It is a pretty literal translation and I'll talk more about that the beginning of next week. I knew I wouldn't have time to put this on a scale for yo,u from 1 to 100, so I'll do that next week, and start putting other translations up there on the scale for you as well, some of the ones we've already talked about. But for now I'll just say this is a pretty literal translation, it definitely leans strongly towards the literal side of things, and so that means it is not the easiest translation to read.
	Its at about a 10th grade reading level, so its not something you could give to a 3rd or 4th grader - they wouldn't be able to read that very well. But as kids get older into middle school, high school, they can start to handle a more literal translation like this. And the best feature of this translation is its very valuable for careful bible study. You want to know if there's a conjunction here, the NASB will come to the rescue and it will give you those conjunctions. Do you want to know if words are coming from the original Greek directly or not, they'll help you with that as well. So there are many good features of the NASB even when I wish they'd done things differently there. They're still doing things that are helpful as long as you understand what's going on. So this is a translation that you should definitely consult when you want to do an in-depth study of the bible. Its one to have on hand and consult. It's a very good translation and we truly are blessed have this translation. 100-200 years ago, they had nothing resembling this, nothing that touches this translation, how good this translation is. Is it perfect? No. But is it a really good translation - yeah, absolutely, it's a very good translation.

<h3 id="6f">closing prayer</h3>

<p class="border1">
So let's close in prayer and thank God for his providence in providing this translation for us. Thank you so much heavenly Father for good bible translations like the NASB. Thank you for all of the godly men you've used to produce this translation starting back in the 60s and 70s. With men like Robert Thomas who was my professor. And now scholars of today who are continuing the work of revising this translation and trying to make it better and better. So thank you for all these godly men who've invested so many hours of work, probably without pay I imagine, or with very little pay. And it just invested in this because they want to serve you, and they want to serve the church. So what a blessing it is to have a good translation like the NASB. And I pray that we would take advantage of such a wonderful blessing like this and dig into good bible translations like the NASB so we can understand exactly what your word is saying to us today so we can live in obedience to you and please you. In Jesus name. Amen.
