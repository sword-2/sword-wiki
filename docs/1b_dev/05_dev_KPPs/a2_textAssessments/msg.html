<br>Substitute teacher this day (S.S.)

<p>The message paraphrase is a version to not use at all. This paraphrase is one to steer clear of. It is being used by some evangelicals.</p>


<p>There's translations like the NIV - if its 84, its good; but afterward it is different. The message paraphrase doesn't have another version that's good. If we see other believers are using the message, give them information [warning / caution]. The teacher knows some believers that had the message paraphrase and strayed from their theology.</p>

<p>It would be easy to say just don't use it. But the message paraphrase sold up to 20 million copies. Believers and unbelievers support it - a list, not in any particular order:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Max Lucado, prominent evangelical</li>
	<li>J.I. Packer, author of knowing God</li>
	<li>Bono, member of the band U2</li>
	<li>Madeleine L'engel, award-winning author of a wrinkle in time</li>
</ul>


<p>What is it about this version that appeals to the culture? Deut 4:2, 12:32, etc says we are never to add to or take away from scripture. But the writer of the message does both. He has an agenda for doing it. It was written Eugene Peterson, a Presbyterian 62-91, a spiritual theology professor in British Columbia 92-98. He began writing in 1993 and released it [message] in bits and pieces until it was finally completed in 2002. This version is not a translation at all, its a liberal subjective interpretation of what one man sees. If anything it is a bad commentary on scripture. However, it is touted as a bible and translation.</p>

<p>Normally when a translation is commissioned - a huge of conglomerate of scholars and theologians come together and go thru the manuscript to make a translation. But Eugene did it himself and touts that he did it on his own. There are places where he corrects scripture to say what he thinks it should have said. Eugene said the original languages [Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic] were street languages and were hard to read, so he wanted to improve the interpretation.</p>

<p>Review of formal and dynamic equivalence. Formal doesn't allow the translator to interject their own ideas. A dynamic is thought-for-thought to make it understandable, but sometimes the message doesn't fall under either, but is a paraphrase. But it is advertised as [<a href="https://www.heartsandmindsbooks.com/2022/11/a-readers-guide-to-the-books-of-eugene-peterson/">dynamic equivalence</a>].</p>


<p>A Quote from Eugene about why he wrote it.
<br>While I was teaching a class on Galatians, I began to realize that the adults in my class weren't feeling the vitality and directness that I sensed ...
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[skipping ahead to the key:]
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hoped to bring the new testament to life for two different types of people: those who hadn't read the bible because it seemed to distant and irrelevant and those who had read the bible so much that it had become 'old hat.</p>

<p>Heb 4:12 says the word of God is living and active, so it is arrogant to say the bible is old hat.</p>

<p>[A <a href="https://www.leaderu.com/marshill/mhr03/peter1.html">quote</a> from Eugene: 
I realized that I could do it [new testament] at that time. But personally, I didn't think I could do it. Maybe I could do Paul, because Paul is easy in a sense because he gets tangled up and you can untangle him. But I didn't think I could ever do the gospels. I agreed to do ten chapters of Matthew at which time John [NavPress editor] would show it to his colleagues to see what they thought. The first few chapters were really bad, I was just plodding along. But when I hit chapter five, the Sermon on the Mount, something kicked in and I suddenly had that sense of "this is what I do". It was then that I thought I was onto something.]</p>


<p>Here's a man who said: The bible to a lot of people is old hat and needs help - I'm the guy who's going to help it. Some verse by verse comparisons [brief quantity since it would take days to do a lot of them].</p>


<table border=1><caption>John 10:30</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 95</td><td>I and the Father are one."</td></tr>
<tr><td>Message</td><td>I and the Father are one heart and mind."</td></tr>
</table>


<p>John 10:30 speaks of the deity of Christ. The message paraphrase added at the end of the verse: in heart and mind. A Jehovah's Witness might like this addition. The message reduces the deity of Christ. Some may not see it as a huge change. But if you do a study of the deity of Christ, it will be more ambiguous in the message paraphrase. Was Eugene appeasing some folks who were struggling with that?</p>



<table border=1><caption>Matthew 5:5</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 95</td><td>"Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Message</td><td>You're blessed when you're content with just who you are - no more, no less.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Matt 5:5 is in the Sermon on the mount. The message translation was a lot different. What does Eugene's translation have to do with Matthew 5:5? Not only does it have nothing to do with the passage, what about its interpretation from various viewpoints of sinners? It makes it sound like being in sin is just fine. Is that what we should be studying? No. But it appeals to culture and relativism. As long as you are content with who you are its OK. Shocking he even came up with something like that.</p>


<p>While filling in for Sunday School, the teacher considered doing a prayer topic. But then at work a conversation came up with a Lieutenant and and Christian. The message paraphrase also came up in that conversation and the Christian thought it was OK. So the teacher decided to talk about the message paraphrase.</p>


<table border=1><caption>1 Corinthians 6:9-11</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 95</td><td>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor <i>the</i> covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Message</td><td>Don't you realize that this is not the way to live? Unjust people who don't care about God will not be joining in his kingdom. Those who use and abuse each other, use and abuse sex, use and abuse the earth and everything in it, don't qualify as citizens in God's kingdom. A number of you know from experience what I'm talking about, for not so long ago you were on that list. Since then, you've been cleaned up and given a fresh start by Jesus, our Master, our Messiah, and by our God present in us, the Spirit.</td></tr>
</table>

 
<p>He [Eugene] willingly and purposely left out homosexuality. There is a Greek word there about it, but he left it out. If you know about the Presbyterian church, they've ordained homosexual men and women - he [Eugene] believed that was a good lifestyle. If a believer gets that paraphrase, they might start thinking the doctrine is OK. Paul was referring to that sin.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using and abusing the earth - where in the world did he get that? It appeals to our culture.</p> 


<table border=1><caption>Romans 1:26-27</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 95</td><td>For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Message</td><td>Worse followed. Refusing to know God, they soon didn't know how to be human either-women didn't know how to be women, men didn't know how to be men. Sexually confused, they abused and defiled one another, women with women, men with men-all lust, no love. And then they paid for it, oh, how they pad for it-emptied of God and love, godless and loveless wretches.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Romans 1:26-27:  In the message paraphrase, the key is at: all lust, no love,  .... He just qualified homosexuality as long is its not lust but love. This is what the substitute teacher discussed with the Lieutenant at work. Pr Caleb did some lessons on homosexuality. Someone struggling with that could use the message paraphrase to say it is OK. Eugene was trying to be more poetic (considering how it sounds) than truthful.</p>


<table border=1><caption>1 Timothy 1:10</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 95</td><td>...and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers...</td></tr>
<tr><td>Message</td><td>...but for the irresponsible, who defy all authority, riding roughshod over God, life, sex, truth, whatever!</td></tr>
</table>

<p>1 Tim 1:10: relativism again. If its OK for you, just make sure its done in love. Its a shame that in our evangelical community that folks bought into this - God loves you as you are. He came to transform not just to be content with who you are.</p>


<table border=1><caption>Romans 8:35</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 95</td><td>Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</td></tr>
<tr><td>Message</td><td>Do you think anyone is going to be able to drive a wedge between us and Christ's love for us? There is no way! Not trouble, not hard times, not hatred, not hunger, not homelessness, not bullying threats, not backstabbing, not even the worst sins listed in Scripture:</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Ro 8:35: The message paraphrase adds backstabbing and the worst sins listed in scripture. He's saying that even sin won't separate us from God. How confusing will it be to witness to an unbeliever who heard Bono teach about this verse and say you can live however you want. Then why did Christ have to die on the cross? Eugene inserts not even the worst sins - a problem because sin is why we need a Savior. If you need one verse for heresy - this one is it. It denigrates Christ on the cross. Eugene was a pastor for a long time - how many were led astray by that? Mr Jackson in 1st service talked about zeal in Titus 2. Zeal includes telling others the truth of scripture. But the message paraphrase will not allow communication of truth. The teacher printed out some verses from the message paraphrase so that he wouldn't have to spend $20 to buy a message paraphrase.</p>

<p>When you go through some of this stuff - really put on your thinking caps. Some errors are subtle, some are brazen. Be cognizant of what God's truth really is to resist false teaching. The only way to know if a message is wrong is if you know scripture.</p>


<table border=1><caption>Galatians 5:19-21</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 95</td><td>Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Message</td><td>It is obvious what kind of life develops out of trying to get your own way all the time: repetitive, loveless, cheap sex; a stinking accumulation of mental and emotional garbage; frenzied and joyless grabs for happiness; trinket gods; magic-show religion; paranoid loneliness; cutthroat competition; all-consuming-yet-never-satisfied wants; a brutal temper; an impotence to love or be loved; divided homes and divided lives; small-minded and lopsided pursuits; the vicious habit of depersonalizing everyone into a rival; uncontrolled and uncontrollable addictions; ugly parodies of community. I could go on.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Galatians 5:19-21: Paul describes the deeds of the flesh. Peterson's message translation: Is there such thing as a controlled addiction? He excused repetitive adultery homosexuality as long as there is love. The word <i>garbage</i> sounds like psychology. In the sheriff's or police, part of the procedure is to get rid of emotional garbage. But that [garbage] is psychology. They need Christ, not psychology</p>




<table border=1><caption>Romans 5:10</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 95</td><td>For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Message</td><td>If, when we were at our worst, we were put on friendly terms with God by the sacrificial death of his Son, now that we're at our best, just think of how our lives will expand and deepen by means of his resurrection life!</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Romans 5:10: In the message translation, "at our best" sounds like Joel Osteen. Eugene interjects that we are at our best. Are we at our best? We are still in the flesh - our best will be in heaven. We think Eugene was catering to culture. But we know this isn't our best life.</p>


<table border=1><caption>Romans 8:3-4</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 2020</td><td>For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God <i>did</i>: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and <i>as an offering</i> for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Message</td><td>God went for the jugular when he sent his own Son. He didn't deal with the problem as something remote and unimportant. In his Son, Jesus, he personally took on the human condition, entered the disordered mess of struggling humanity in order to set it right once and for all. The law code, weakened as it always was by fractured human nature, could never have done that.
	<br><br>
	The law always ended up being used as a Band-Aid on sin instead of a deep healing of it. And now what the law code asked for but we couldn't deliver is accomplished as we, instead of redoubling our own efforts, simply embrace what the Spirit is doing in us.
	</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Romans 8:3-4: The message paraphrase [Eugene] omitted the word sin. Was humanity struggling, dying, or dead - little subtleties? Humanity wasn't struggling but was dead. Christ made us alive through his death. Eugene minimized sin. A quote was not found that Peter was a universalist, but it sounds like he was. He says Adam was deceived like Eve - again minimizing sin. It was estimated as time went on, Eugene moved toward universalism - the culture dictated what was said.</p>


<table border=1><caption>1 Corinthians 14:34-35</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 2020</td><td>the women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says. If they desire to learning anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak at church.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Message</td><td>Wives must not disrupt worship, talking when they should be listening, asking questions that could more appropriately be asked of their husbands at home. God's Book of the law guides our manners and customs here. Wives have no license to use the time of worship for unwarranted speaking. Do you-both women and men-imagine that you're a sacred oracle determining what's right and wrong? Do you think everything revolves around you?</td></tr>
</table>


<p>1 Corinthians 14:34-35: The Lord setup up roles for men and women. However, women don't have leadership role in church. But Peterson changed it at a time when women pastors were being ordained. The message paraphrase has a subtle word change. In the substitute teacher's opinion, Eugene has the term unwarranted speaking. Have you heard of Beth Moore? She uses this and the message paraphrase to say she can preach because she's authorized by the elders of her church (using the message). When you have a paraphrase like this, you can justify whatever you want to do.</p>


<p>One more passage - hopefully it is enough to know to stay away from the message.</p>

<table border=1><caption>1 Timothy 2:9-15</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 2020</td><td>Likewise, <i>I want</i> women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or expensive apparel, but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness. A women must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness. But I do not allow a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet. For <i>it was</i> Adam who was first created, <i>and</i> then Eve. And <i>it was</i> not Adam <i>who</i> was deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a wrongdoer. But women will be preserved through childbirth-if they continue in faith, love, and sanctity, with moderation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Message</td><td>Since prayer is at the bottom of all this, what I want mostly is for men to pray-not shaking angry fists at enemies but raising holy hands to God. And I want women to get in there with the men in humility before God, not primping before a mirror or chasing the latest fashions but doing something beautiful for God and becoming beautiful doing it.
		<br><br>
	I don't let women take over and tell the men what to do. They should study to be quiet and obedient along with everyone else. Adam was made first, then Eve; woman was deceived first-our pioneer in sin!-with Adam right on her heels. On the other hand, her childbearing brought about salvation, reversing Eve. But this salvation only comes to those who continue in faith, love, and holiness, gathering it all into maturity. You can depend on this.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>1 Timothy 2:9-15: He [Eugene] says reversing salvation. The subtle changes to a woman's role in church and home allows for doing whatever you feel is right. Maybe semantically this isn't what he meant - Adam took willingly. Through 1 man sin entered? He's changed that sin entering though 1 man (Romans 5:12, 16, and 19). Women's role in church is important. They do tremendous things in church - children's ministry, etc. But it has to be done in God's designed roles. You look at qualifications for elders - it has a role if a man desires. Eugene has adulterated scripture.</p>


<p>Sometimes people try to say Eugene only changed a few verses. But really Eugene changed a lot from Genesis through Revelation. You are challenged not to use the message translation. If you find someone using it, lovingly steer them to another translation. You can't recognize these errors without knowing God's word. The message paraphrase sold a lot of commentaries since its culturally relevant. The substitute teacher wanted to go into something that unfortunately has taken root among believers. Just because he [Eugene] was a Pastor, a good Berean searches the scriptures [Acts 17:10-11]. In all cases we need to research the scripture and teachings.</p>
