<h3 id="3a">Review - approaches to bible translation</h3>

<p class="border1">
Well last week we finished doing an introduction to the subject of bible translations. And we've talked now about the 2 major approaches to bible translation. We talked about formal equivalence and dynamic equivalence, and I mentioned to you that there is no single English bible translation that uses only 1 of these approaches. All bible translations use both formal equivalence and dynamic equivalence to a certain degree. Some will lean more toward dynamic equivalence, some will lean more toward formal equivalence, but all of them use both of these approaches to some degree. And so we can think of this as a spectrum with 2 extremes, say 1 would be formal equivalence, 100 would be dynamic equivalence and all translations would fall somewhere between these 2 extremes. There is a lot of diversity among bible translations today, there's no 2 translations that take exactly the same approach to the balance between these 2 approaches. So I do think it's valuable to use multiple bible translations on a regular basis. There are good reasons to have different translations, different purposes for having them. So if you want to read quickly through the bible for example, you'll want to use a translation that leans more toward dynamic equivalence, because it's going to be a more readable bible translation. If you want to study the bible more deeply, then I would suggest using a bible translation that leans more toward formal equivalence, because its going to be more literal, its going to correspond more closely to the original languages of scripture, the original text. And when we get to the very end of our study, who knows how long that'll take, it could be awhile. I will recommend several bible translations for these different purposes. I'll say I like this one for this purpose, and this one for this purpose. And so once we get through them all, and I give you a survey of all the translations, I'll give you my conclusions about them.

<h3 id="3b">Review - earliest translations</h3>

<p class="border1">
Last week we also talked about some of the earliest bible translations that were done in other languages. Does anyone remember the name of the very first translation of the bible, and what language it was in? [student answered the Vulgate]. Vulgate was an early one, not the earliest. What was the earliest? [student's 2nd answer was Septuagint]. The Septuagint was the very first translation of the bible. And what language was that in? [student answered Greek]. That was in Greek. This translation was so early that it was actually completed before the new testament was written, it was done during the 2nd and 3rd centuries before Christ. And so it only covered  the the old testament. Then after the new testament was written in Greek, then that new testament could be combined with the Septuagint to form a Greek bible. And the Greek bible was very popular for quite a few years. But then before too much time passed a new translation appeared that soon became the most dominant and popular translation of the bible, and that was the one that someone mentioned earlier - what was that one? [student answered Vulgate]. The Vulgate. And what language was the Vulgate written in? [student: Latin]. It was in Latin. This translation was finished in the year 405 after Christ. And this translation reigned supreme among bible translations for over a 1000 years. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt3, '01:52', '03:12')">audio</a>
</p>



<h3 id="3c">Review - events ending dominance of the Latin Vulgate</h3>
<p class="border1">
But there were 2 events that took place that combined to bring an end to the dominance of this translation otherwise it might still be the most dominant translation today. But there were 2 important things that happened, that brought an end to the reign of this translation, as the supreme translation. Does anybody remember these 2 events? [student: printing press]. The printing press, that's right, that was invented in the 1400s. So a little over a 1000 years after the Vulgate was completed. And then there was a 2nd event that happened at about a generation later. What was that? [student: protestant reformation]. Yeah, the protestant reformation took place in the early 1500s. Men like Martin Luther and John Calvin during the protestant reformation were calling people to return back to the bible and turn their back on unbiblical traditions that have been passed down in the Catholic church. And so they basically taught that the bible is the final authority for all our beliefs and practices.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it's no surprise that the protestant reformation sparked an explosion of new bible translations that was facilitated by the printing press. The printing press made it possible to produce all these bible translations very quickly. And there were not just a new translations in English, many other languages got new translations as well. But of course English was one of those languages. Does anyone remember who the man was who first published the new testament in English? What was his name? [student: William]. William Tyndale, yes. He translated the new testament from Greek, so not from Latin the popular bible of the day, but from the original Greek and then he published that new testament in 1526. And that was just 9 years after Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses on the doors. So he worked pretty fast, this spark took place very quickly here and all of a sudden there's an explosion of new bible translations happening within the first 10 years. Unfortunately Tyndale did not get to the finish the whole bible, he did start working on the old testament. He finish the Pentateuch, he did a couple other books in the old testament, and then he was imprisoned. He continued to work on it in prison, but then he was put to death. And it came down to other men to be able to finish his work, to continue that work, and publish the whole bible. And there were several different full bibles that were published during the 1500s.

<h3 id="3d">King James Version (KJV)</h3>

<p class="border1">
But then in the year 1603 king James came to the throne in England. And he decided to authorize a new bible translation. And this translation was finished and published in 1611. And appropriately it was called the king James version, sometimes it's also called an authorized version, and that's just pointing us back to the fact that it was authorized by king James. A suggestion was made him - hey how about we do a bible translation and he jumped all over that idea, and said yes that's what I wanna do. And so he was very enthusiastic about this project, kind of wanted to put his stamp on it, so he would attend the different meetings and give input into that, and tell them what he wanted them to do. And so this was sort of his baby, this was his legacy, he's of course very well known for this today as the person who authorized this translation.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt3, '05:33', '06:22')">audio</a>
</p>


<img src="1611.png" alt="Picture of 1611 KJV" width="500" height="500">

<p class="border1">
And it wasn't too much later, maybe like 40 or 50 years later, that the KJV became the most popular bible translation in English. The Geneva bible did remain popular for many years, I talked about the Geneva bible last week which was done in 1516 and it was very popular. And it was still the most popular bible for a while, but after about 40 or 50 years after the king James came out, it became the most popular bible translation. And by the 1700s, the early 1700s, the KJV was basically the only bible translation out there in English, it was the only one being used. And even today it continues to be used by many people. Now this doesn't mean that the king James used today is the same one that was published in 1611. If you ever have gotten a chance to look at a king James from 1611, one of the original king James bibles, you would struggle quite a bit to read it. Let me show you a picture from a 1611 king James bible. And I know its going to be hard to see this cause its pretty small there, but if you're sitting up close here, maybe you can give a shot at reading it. And what you'll see is that it's pretty tough to read. First of all we have a problem here of a Gothic font that they used instead of the more traditional Roman fonts. So that was how they published it at first. And I'm sure that people were probably used to reading in a font like that. But still for us today that's very difficult to read in this kind of fancy Gothic font. But then another thing that we see, and you can see it right at the very top, is they actually spelled quite a few words differently. So notice the word book there has the letter e on the end of it, and if you were to keep reading through Genesis 1 there, you would see that there are lots of words there that are spelled differently.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt3, '06:22', '08:05')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
So between the Gothic font and the different spellings of words, you would really struggle to read an original 1611 version of the king James bible. And so most people who use the king James today, in fact I think its probably safe to say almost everyone who uses the KJV today is not using the 1611 edition because it would be very difficult to read that. No, what happened was over time the KJV was updated and revised, there were several different points when that happened.
The final time that it happened was in 1769. And so most people who use the KJV today are using the 1769 revision of the 1611 KJV. And it is quite a bit different from the original 1611. Scholars have studied the differences and they've counted about 100,000 differences. So just counting up how many words there are, I think about 700,000 words in the KJV, and out of those 700,000 about one 100,000 of them are different. Whether it comes down to spelling changes or just a few tweaks, most of the changes have to do with spelling changes, but you know there are quite a few differences, about a 100,000 different places where there are differences, not just in spelling, but there are also changes in punctuation as well.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt3, '08:05', '09:25')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
So this is the KJV that is in regular use today, the 1769 edition. But most of these changes are not really that significant. Yes, there are a lot of changes but most of the words are basically the same as before, just maybe with spelling differences and that sort of thing. It's very hard to find really significant changes going from 1611 to 1769. So it is an authentic KJV with just some, you know I think, legitimate important updates that needed to be made, that keep up with the changes in the English language. So the KJV people use it isn't significantly different from the original 1611 edition. It is good to be aware that when you read the KJV you're probably not reading the 1611 edition unless somehow you have access to one. They're very hard to find, they're in libraries usually or museums and they're under glass and they're protected and everything. I think the Master's seminary has an original 1611 KJV close by so you can go down there and look at one in person if you'd like to, but I'm sure they wouldn't let you touch it or open it, cause it's very fragile course, being so old. But just keep in mind, if you do use the KJV, you look for it online and you're using in on biblegateway, you're not looking at the 1611 edition, its the 1769 edition, this updated edition.

<h3 id="3e">KJV - memorable verses</h3>

<p class="border1">
So what I want to do now is take a look at some of the most memorable verses in the 1769 edition of the KJV. The KJV has a very high literary quality to it. The people who translated it took great pains to put it in a very smooth English. And so it's very elegant and beautiful. And that's one of the reasons its remained popular for so long. There are many statements in the KJV that just have a wonderful cadence and rhythm to them. So let's take a look at some of these popular versus in the KJV that are so familiar to us, even if you've never read the KJV, you might've heard some of the statements that come from the KJV. Let's start with one from the book of Psalms, the preeminent book of poetry in the bible. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt3, '10:44', '11:33')">audio</a>
</p>

 

<table border=1><caption>memorable verse - Ps 119:105</caption>
<tr><th>Reference</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr>
	<td>Psalm 119:105</td>
	<td>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
Here is Psalm 119:105 [verse read]. So that just has a really nice smooth sound to it. Obviously, there are some old English words there that we don't use much anymore, but that's a very clear translation in old English at least, they would've understood this very clearly. And I love this verse, I love the imagery here, the idea that God's word is like a lamp that gives light to us in the dark, that's a really great image, and something that we can all relate to right?
	<br>&nbsp; Because every day the sun comes up and then it goes down, so we have our day time and we have our night time. Now in our modern times its a little bit harder to understand darkness right? Okay so you go on a night and yes it is dark out, but there's still a lot lights there right? We have artificial light everywhere, we have our light switches in our house, we have our street lights out there on the roads and sidewalks. And so there's a lot of artificial light out, we don't really I think have a good understanding of what darkness really is. If you've ever gone into a cave as I did when I was a kid and then they just shut off the lights at a certain point, that's real darkness right there.
	<br>&nbsp; Or maybe you like to go out camping, when the weather's nice and you get out in the woods, and you're away from all this artificial light, and all you have is the moon and the stars out there giving you a little bit of light. And if its a new moon, then its just the stars, it's pretty dark and you wouldn't wanna be out there without a flashlight because you'd be stumbling around and trying to find the outhouse, you know, or get down to the water that you need, that sort of thing. It's very interesting to to experience a deeper form of darkness than what we have on a daily basis in our modern culture.
	<br>&nbsp; But hopefully you have been able to experience that at some point in your life, to see a little bit more what real darkness is like, because then I think you can more appreciate what this verse is saying. When you really have a need for a flashlight, know know when it's dark out, maybe when the powers out on your street and the street lights aren't working and you have no artificial light working in your house. Where's that flashlight, you're fumbling around for it - and you realize - man, I really need this thing or I'm not going to be able to see where I'm going, going to really struggle.
Well God's word is like that in our lives. It gives us light, it shows us the direction that we need to go in life. It gives us guidance for our lives. It shows us how to live in the way that pleases God.
So this is a wonderful verse in the KJV, it has a very memorable translation of it. I think this has even been set to song, and it's been sung in churches in the last couple of decades.

<p class="border1">
Let's look now at another memorable verse in the KJV, Isaiah 40:31 [verse read]. This is just a really powerful verse. Its been a comfort to so many Christians for so many years. When we're going through hard times we know that we can follow what this verse is teaching us - wait upon the LORD, trust in him, and he will give us the strength that we need to persevere through difficult times.

	<td>Matt 6:33</td>
	<td>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
Now let's look at another verse in the KJV, one that is well known, Matthew 6:33 [verse read]. This verse is also very powerful, it has a really great reminder that we need to keep God first in our lives. Seek ye first the kingdom of God, make God and his kingdom and his righteousness first in our lives. So our focus should be in in life on doing things that matter for eternity, things that the God wants us to be doing, storing up treasure in heaven instead of treasure on earth. That's what Jesus said just a little bit earlier in this chapter.
	<br>&nbsp; And so what this verse is talking about is - hey don't worry about the things of life. Yes there are things that we need like food and water and clothing and those sorts of things, but don't worry, God will provide those things - all these things shall be added unto you. No, that doesn't mean everything that you would ever want, but no, it just means that things that you need. The context there is talking about food and clothing. And when we're pursuing God and doing what pleases him, he will provide for our needs.

<tr>
	<td>John 3:16</td>
	<td>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
Now let's look at one more memorable verse in the KJV, and this is probably the most memorable verse in the entire bible. Does anyone know what verse I'm talking about? [student: John 3:16]. John 3:16. Many Christians have learned John 3:16 in the KJV. We might even be able to recite it together right [verse read]. I memorized this verse in the KJV way back when I was I think 5 years old, cause it was the key verse in AWANA for the Sparks group - kindergarten through 2nd grade. And I think it still is today. Many people aren't memorizing it in the KJV anymore, but that was how we learned it back when I was a kid. And this just has the great flow and a great ring to it, I think even today people can still understand this in the KJV. There's a couple of archaic terms in there, but nothing that is really severely archaic and very difficult to understand. So this is a great verse. If you only memorize 1 verse in the bible, this would be a great choice. It has a powerful statement about God's love for us - it touches on the very heart of the gospel, and how God sent Jesus to earth to die for us. It doesn't talk about all those details, but it just kind of summarizes God sent his son for us. And if we put our faith in him, if we trust in him to save us based on his work on the cross, then we will have everlasting life, we will live with Jesus forever instead of being punished for our sins. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So those are 4 I think of the most memorable verses in the KJV. We can add many more to this list, but these are 4 that I think are very powerful and that many Christians memorized, and that just have really smooth rhythm to them in the KJV.

<h3 id="3f">KJV - about 90% of the KJV new testament was from Tyndale's new testament</h3>

<p class="border1">
But the translators of the KJV were not starting from scratch as we talked about last week. They were building on the work of previous translators. And as I told you last week about 90% of the KJV in the new testament comes directly from Tyndale's new testament. And I want to show you some of the memorable statements in the KJV that come directly from Tyndale's new testament.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt3, '17:37', '18:04')">audio</a>
</p>




<table border=1><caption>from Tyndale - Matthew 5:9</caption>
<tr><th>Reference</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr>
	<td>Matthew 5:9</td>
	<td>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
Take a look there at Matthew 5:9. This is in the KJV [verse read]. This whole verse is taken word-for-word from Tyndale's new testament - of course taking into account spelling changes and that sort of thing. And in fact there is a word in here that Tyndale actually came up with. Can you guess what word it is? The word did not exist before Tyndale's new testament. [student: peacemakers]. Peacemakers, that was a new word he came up with this word as he was looking at the original Greek text, trying to come up with a way to translate this. And he realized there is no good way to translate this - I need to make up a word. So he made up this word peacemaker here, and the KJV just borrowed from that, they just took it right from Tyndale's new testament - a little bit of plagiarism there. Tyndale should be recognized for this verse, it's word-for-word right from Tyndale's new testament.

<tr>
	<td>Matthew 7:7</td>
	<td>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
Now look at Matthew 7:7 a little bit later in the sermon on the mount. This also comes word-for-word from Tyndale's new testament [verse read]. I just love the rhythm here of this translation, it has a great flow to it. But this wasn't from the king James translators, they just stole this right from Tyndale's new testament word-for-word. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt3, '19:01', '19:27')">audio</a>

<!--
Skippped administrative difficulty:
except they added one word here, it's the word and ah right, oh I'm sorry I'm looking ahead to the next verse. This is word-for-word directly from Matthew 7:7. The next verse I show you is not exactly the same, but its close

<tr><th>Reference</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr>
	<td>Acts 17:28a</td>
	<td>For in him we live, and move, and have our being;</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
So let's look at the next one - Acts 17:28, the very beginning of the verse [verse read]. This is a statement that just has a really nice flow and ring to it, and its a phrase I think many Christians are familiar with, because its still preserved in many of our modern translations. But once again this comes almost exactly word-for-word from Tyndale's new testament. It's just that word and right before the word move that Tyndale didn't have. I compared it, and he didn't put the word and before the word move. He just had it before the word have. The king James translators added in there, but otherwise they're using exactly the same words that Tyndale used at the beginning of this verse.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt3, '19:40', '20:23')">audio</a>

<tr>
	<td>Romans 13:1</td>
	<td>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
Let's look at one more verse where we see us strong influence from the Tyndale new testament here. Romans 13:1 [verse read]. This is not exactly word-for-word from Tyndale's new testament. The very first sentence there has quite a few modifications from Tyndale's new testament, but if we were to look at the 2nd sentence here, the 2nd half of this verse, it is word-for-word from Tyndale's new testament. And there's actually a phrase in there that had never been used before in English before Tyndale published his new testament. Its that phrase "the powers that be". You see that phrase there - the powers that be? That was coined by Tyndale, that had never been used before in English as far as we can tell.
And that is a popular phrase that even today people are using. People will still say today - the powers that be, and they'll just be talking about those who are in government. That's a popular phrase because of William Tyndale and the king James translators were smart enough to say - hey, Tyndale did a good job here, let's just steal what he put in his new testament.

<h3 id="3g">Places where the KJV probably should've stuck with Tyndale's new testament</h3>

<p class="border1">
So William Tyndale's influence on the KJV was very significant. I talked about this briefly last week, but I want a circle back to this - show you some really good examples. Tyndale did such a good job in his translation that it had a huge impact on English bible translations for hundreds of years. But the KJV does not always agree with Tyndale's new testament. Sometimes there are changes, and occasionally those changes are good, but sometimes they are not so good. Let me show you a few places where the KJV probably should've stuck with Tyndale's new testament translation.

We'll start with Matthew 26:27 - this is one example where Tyndale's new testament is superior I think to the KJV. So we'll start with the KJV here and then I'll compare it with Tyndale's new testament. Here's what the KJV says in Matthew 26:27 [verse read]. This verses is of course talking about the last supper that Jesus had with his disciples right before his death. There are 28 chapters in Matthew, chapter 28 has the resurrection, 27 has the crucifixion, 26 is talking about the events that led right up to the crucifixion. So Jesus had a final supper with his disciples, and he taught them to remember his imminent death by eating some bread and drinking some wine together. And so in this verse of course Jesus was talking about the wine that they drank. And notice what Jesus said to do with the wine according to the KJV. He told his disciples to drink all of it - to drink all of the wine. I once read a story about a small church where they would fill a picture of wine when they would celebrate the Lord's supper. And because the church was kind of small, there would usually be a lot of wine left over in that pitcher. And so the preacher, you know as he's taking care of putting things away at the end, and he was using this verse of course to celebrate the Lord's supper, he thought to himself - oh man, we better make sure that we drink all this wine. So he would actually drink the rest of the pitcher of wine and end up being drunk before too long. He felt he was between a rock and a hard place there, and that it was better just to go and drink the wine even if it meant getting drunk. And he was basing that decision on this verse in the KJV. But that is not what Jesus is actually saying here. The KJV does not have an accurate translation from the original Greek.
Tyndale's new testament translation here is more accurate, and you'll have to weed through the different spelling changes, but you can see how some of these words are spelled differently back in the 1500s, and we can still make sense of it [verse read]. Notice that difference there at the end - it doesn't say drink all of it, it says drink of it every one. So in other words this isn't saying that the people are to drink all of the wine when they celebrate the Lord's supper, it just means that every believer in the church is to drink some of the wine. And in our church, we put it in little cups so that there's no danger of becoming drunk. Just take a little sip and of course its even grape juice in our church. But if it were wine, you wouldn't get drunk, it wouldn't be a problem, but we steer clear of wine cause some people, if you take a little wine, you want more, so we want to guard against that. 
So this is the more accurate way to interpret this verse and its followed in all the major bible translations of today. Here's the CSB as an example [verse read]. So a few changes there from Tyndale, but it basically means the same thing that Tyndale had. Most bible translations follow Tyndale here, and they're taking the right approach.

Yeah, question. Student - If you were to put a comma after the all, then it would work - drink ye all, of it. Right, we would need that punctuation there, but they didn't put that punctuation there, and so its very misleading there. If they intended to convey what Tyndale did, they didn't do a very good job. It would have been better to just keep what Tyndale had, that's what they did in many other places, they just copied Tyndale. Why they thought they needed to change in here, I do not understand, it doesn't make any sense. Unfortunately, it has misled many people throughout the years. So that's one verse where I think Tyndale's new testament is superior to the KJV.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at in another place where Tyndale's new testament is superior to the KJV, 1 Corinthians 14:27. Here's what the KJV says [verse read]. Notice that there are a lot of words here in italics. And I'm not adding those italics myself, those come right from the KJV. What the KJV translators did, I don't know if this was back in the original 1611, or if they did it later in the 1769 edition, but there are words italics here. And the reason they put the italics here was to show us that there are places here where the translators have added words that aren't really taken from the original Greek. So these different words and phrases in italics, there's not a corresponding Greek word or phrase there. What they're doing is they're just adding these words for clarification, to try to make it look smoother or to kind of convey what they think is the right interpretation here. Most of the words here in italics are fine, but there is one word here that is I think a big problem. Can anyone guess what word that is? What word is the most significant here in italics? [student: unknown]. Unknown. This one I think is a problem. This word appears in italics right before the word tongue, not just in this verse, but 6 times total in this chapter. This is the only place where we see that phrase unknown tongue in the KJV. 6 times and they always put italics because there is no Greek word here for unknown. And the problem is that this word implies that the gift of tongues did not involve real languages. So it just sort of this unknown thing out there that nobody knows. Its just kind of gibberish you could say. But this creates a contradiction between this chapter and Acts 2. Acts 2 is where we see the gift of tongues in action for the very first time. In Acts 2 it's very clear that its a reference to real actual languages. And so the KJV doesn't add the word unknown in Acts 2 like they do here. But there is no basis for adding this word unknown here and trying to create a difference in interpretation between the 2 passages - there's no Greek word for unknown here. There's no implication from the text here in this passage, from the context, that we should be understanding this any differently then the tongues in Acts 2. Both of the passages are talking about real languages, and so I think it's inappropriate to add the word unknown here. This just adds confusion I think to the passage.
Once again Tyndale's new testament is more accurate on this issue. Take a look at Tyndale's translation [verse read]. Notice the word unknown is not there. The KJV translators added that word, they thought they knew better than Tyndale, but they didn't. They should've followed Tyndale here.
And I'll show you also the CSB. They also don't add to word unknown here either. In most, I don't think there is any other modern translations that have the word unknown, they just say - if anyone speaks in a tongue. That is the better approach here, than adding the word unknown.
So that's another verse where I think Tyndale did a better job than the KJV.

<p class="border1">
Let me show you another example here - 1 Timothy 2:12. The KJV says [verse read].
This verse teaches more clearly than any other verse in scripture that women are not to teach or to have authority over men in church. But notice that the KJV has the word usurp there. And this is a misleading translation because it leaves the door open for women to have authority in the church as long as they're not taking it by force. That's kind of what the word usurp implies, as long as you don't take it by force, then its fine to have authority. And so the idea is that if the leaders of the church grants that authority to women in the church, then they're not usurping it, and they're not in violation of this passage according to the KJV. 
But Tyndale's new testament here is more faithful to the original Greek. Tyndale said [verse read]. So there is no word usurp here. He has the word have instead - to have authority - this does not leave any wiggle room for women to have a authority in the church. And this is the best way to interpret the original Greek. Tyndale was on the right track here. 
And we see the same interpretation in many modern translations like the CSB [verse read]. That phrase have authority is the same thing that Tyndale has with the spelling changes taken into account there. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I've shown you 3 places, and I could keep going of course, but I'll just give you a few examples here in these different categories. These are several examples, 3 different examples, where I think Tyndale's new testament was superior to the KJV.

<h3 id="3h">KJV - obsolete language</h3>

<p class="border1">
The KJV is not a perfect bible translation. There is no such thing and the KJV is not even an ideal translation for people to use today. And one of the reasons for that is that English language has changed a lot. Not even from 1611, its changed a ton from 1611, but if we just go back to 1769, the last time the KJV was revised, well the English language has changed a lot since that time as well. And so I want to show you some passages where the KJV has obsolete language. There is a lot of obsolete language in the KJV, where English has changed, and we have words that are just no longer in use anymore. They were used back in the 1600s and 1700s, but not anymore.

Take a look there at Proverbs 29:24 [KJV read]. When is the last time you used the word bewrayeth? I don't think I'd ever even heard of that word until I read it here in this passage. The word bewrayeth is just an old English word, and it means to reveal. It means to reveal. Here is this verse in the CSB [verse read]. So to testify is to reveal the evidence you could say. So that is a more of accurate translation in modern day English. The word bewrayeth just does not really help us to understand what's going on here. So this is very obsolete language.

<p class="border1">
Here's another place in the KJV where we have obsolete language - Jeremiah 17:4 [verse read]. It seems like almost every other word there is archaic and we don't use a lot of these words any more. Most these words that are obsolete are pronouns - thou, thyself, thine, thee, ye, even the pronoun mine there, we use mine but not in that same way, we would put the word my there not mine. So there are a lot of archaic pronouns in this verse and so it's much easier to read this in a modern English translation like the CSB [verse read]. So now we have a modern English pronouns in this verse and its much easier to read and understand what's going on there. All those old pronouns, we don't use those anymore, they were a part of old English, but they're all obsolete now.

Let me show you one other verse in the KJV that has obsolete language - Philippians 1:23-24. Here's the KJV [verse read]. That word strait there used to refer to it a narrow space, and we still do use it to refer to a specific type of narrow space, to a channel of water, but it was used more broadly back in the old days. That word betwixt, we don't use that anymore, that's just an old English word that means between. So here is a more modern way of saying this, the CSB just says [verse read]. The KJV is kind of tricky to understand. You can probably figure it out, especially if you look up some of these words in an old dictionary, but why should have to pause and look at words in a dictionary to understand. Let's just use modern English instead. So this is another passage that has archaic old obsolete English in it. And I can give you, of course, dozens and dozens of more examples, but those are 3 that really stuck out to me.

<h3 id="3i">KJV - misleading language</h3>

<p class="border1">
Now I want to show you some verses the KJV that aren't obsolete, the language is not obsolete, but it is misleading now because words change meaning over time.
So let me show you a few places where we have this. This is actually a more serious problem because now you don't even know that you're wrongly understanding a verse, because the words there, we still use them, but they just have different meanings now. So here is a good example from Deuteronomy 7:21 - hopefully all of you would be able to catch this one [KJV verse read]. Now the word terrible in modern English means extremely bad. And I think we all know that that is not what it means here right. The scripture does not say that God is an extremely bad God. No this is an example of a word that used to have a different meaning to it and it's kind of changed over time in its meaning. We still use it, but not with the same meaning. Back in the old days it basically meant awesome and that is the word that we find in many modern English translations like the CSB. It says [part of verse read]. That's just the modern English way of handling the original Hebrew here. The word terrible is now misleading and it will cause people to reach the wrong conclusions if they don't know much about God, if they haven't read scripture and come to see God as holy in sinless, right? Then they might draw these wrong conclusions here.

<p class="border1">
Let me show you another example of this - James 2:3 - you're gonna catch this one as well [KJV verse read]. Now in the KJV this makes it sound like the people were showing favoritism toward homosexuals, people who were dressing as homosexuals. That is not at all what this passage is saying. And that's because the word gay as most of you know, especially if you've been alive for a while, this word has changed meaning very recently, in the last generation or 2. This word basically just used to mean happy, or bright, or cheerful. Now of course, people don't use it that way anymore, they're afraid to use it in that way for fear of being misunderstood. The word has been hijacked. Here is the CSB translation of this verse [verse read]. That's a better way now to translate into modern English, cause the word gay would be miss-leading - this is just talking about showing favoritism toward those who are wealthy and have the money to buy really nice expensive clothes. We should not be doing that - we shouldn't be showing favoritism toward people based on how wealthy they are, whether they're rich or poor. So this is another place where the KJV has misleading language. This isn't obsolete language, the word gay is still in use, but has a totally different meaning now then it used to have back in the old days.

<p class="border1">
Let me show you one more passage with obsolete language in the KJV. Look at 1 Peter 1:15 [KJV verse read]. Now in the KJV, it sounds like Peter is commanding us here to be holy in our speech. That's how we use the word conversation today. But that is not what the word meant a couple 100 years ago, it was used to refer more generally to conduct or behavior. Look at this verse in the CSB [verse read]. So this verse is talking about much more than just our speech. I think this includes our speech certainly, but this is talking about the need for us to be separate from sin in every area of our lives, not just in our conversation. The KJV is misleading here because this word conversation has changed in its meaning or time. It is now more narrow. It had a broader meaning back then, now it has a more narrow meaning. And so it can mislead into taking a more narrow interpretation here than what the original Greek is conveying to us. So those are 3 passages that have miss-leading language, to go with those 3 earlier passages that have obsolete language. And I could give you many more examples of this as well. But those I think are 3 very clear examples.

But there are also verses in the KJV that have just clear misinterpretations. Over the years, bible scholars have become much more skilled in handling the original languages of scripture. And as a result, they've improved in their understanding of scripture, and bible translations can benefit from the advanced studies that bible scholars have been doing for the last few hundred years, building on each other's shoulders, and just improving in their interpretations of scripture. So I want to show you a couple places where the KJV has a misinterpretation of scripture. Maybe at the time they couldn't have really known better back then, but now with further study over these many years, we can come to an improved understanding of these passages.

<p class="border1">
Let's start with Proverbs 3:5-6. These are very well known verses. I memorized these out of the KJV. Look at what they say here in the KJV [verse read]. This is a favorite passage for many Christians right? It tells us that we need to be trusting in the LORD and not just sometimes, not just with part of who we are, but with every aspect of our beings. We shouldn't be depending on our own understanding, but just depending on the LORD and on his word. And the promise here is that if we will do that, if we will trust in the LORD, if we will acknowledge him in all our ways, then we are told in the KJV that he will direct our paths, or in archaic English, he shall direct thy paths.
And so it sounds here like God will guide us in the direction that he wants to go if we will trust in him and acknowledge him in our lives. And many Christians have jumped on this and thought that this applies to major decisions in our lives, like who should we marry specifically. And where does God want us to live. Well, if we'll just trust in him than he will show us the direction that we need to go. But this view is based on a misinterpretation of this passage. And most modern bible translations have been improved understanding of this passage. Take a look at the CSB here as an example - I could show you other translations, but look at the CSB here [verse read].
in Proverbs, the image of the straight path is pointing us to a righteous life that pleases God. And its compared with the crooked path - the crooked path is the person who is acting wickedly - he's going astray from that straight and narrow path of righteousness.
So this passage is not talking about decisions where God's word has given us freedom, like who we need to marry. If you were with us for 1 Corinthians a few weeks ago, you know that 1 Corinthians 7:39 tells us that a window can get married to anyone she wants only in the Lord. In other words, marrying an eligible single christian man. And there's freedom there, you don't have to wait for God to try to show you exactly who to marry, you are free to marry anyone you wish. And I think that passage has implications not just for windows, but for widowers and for all other single people, especially single people who've never been married before. They're free to stay single, they're free to get married. If they get married, they're free to marry anyone they want, as long as that person is an eligible single person of the opposite gender who is a Christian, that is what matters.
So we shouldn't be expecting God to show us, to direct our paths, and show us exactly what he wants us to do in these different areas that are not commanded in scripture. That would take away our freedom that God has given to us. No, the CSB has the better interpretation here. This is a much more literal translation and it's the best way to understand this text. It's just saying that when we're trusting in the Lord and growing in our knowledge of him, the word know there is a better translation than acknowledge, if we're seeking God, to know him better, then he will enable us to walk righteously and live in a way that pleases him. And he does that of course through his Holy Spirit who lives in us.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at another passage in the KJV that has a misinterpretation. Look at Isaiah 14:12 [verse read].
So in this chapter, Isaiah was giving a message of judgment against the king of Babylon. But then here out of nowhere it seems in verse 12, we have this name Lucifer in the KJV. And most people have understood the word Lucifer to be a reference to Satan. Its a name of Satan and it's not a reference to the king of Babylon. But 
this is not the right interpretation here, the word Lucifer is just a transliteration which is a letter-for-letter equivalent from the word used in the Latin Vulgate here. The KJV translators were relying on the Latin Vulgate here, there's a word in Latin that sounds just like Lucifer. I forget exactly how its pronounced, but its very similar. And so they're just taking that letter-for-letter from the Latin and putting it into English and treating it like a name. But in Latin that word Lucifer just refers to a shining star. And that's actually a very good translation from the original Hebrew. The Latin Vulgate here does a good job of translating from Hebrew. Its just that people later misinterpret this and understood it to be name instead of just a generic reference to a shining star.
Look at the CSB for this verse [verse read]. So the word Lucifer isn't here, this is a more literal translation from the original Hebrew. So this verse is not referring to Satan here. There is no evidence in the immediate context here in chapter 14 that there's any focus here on anyone besides the king of Babylon. This as a reference to the king of Babylon. Now sure, some of the statements that are made here in this verse and in later verses do seem a little bit extreme - fallen from the heavens. Wouldn't that better refer to Satan? Well we need to keep in mind that ancient kings thought of themselves as gods. King Herod certainly thought of himself as a god and when he accepted worship as a god, God struck him down and put him to death in Acts 12 or 11, somewhere in there. And in ancient times the same thing was true. The king of Babylon, he was the preeminent king in the world, he had this huge empire, he would have though of himself as a god. And so I think when Isaiah wrote his words of judgment here, God chose to give him words that would kind of meet the king on his level, where he thought he was basically. Oh, you wanna think of yourself as a <s>king</s> [god] then I'll proclaim judgment on you as though your pretending to be a god and not just simply a regular human king.
So this is not a reference to Satan, this is just a clever way of referring to the king of Babylon here according to the context. And most modern bible translations I think fit with that view very well like the CSB.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at another verse in the KJV that has a misinterpretation - Romans 8:16. In the KJV this verse says [verse read].
Notice that there is emphasis here on the Holy Spirit through the presence of this pronoun right after the word Spirit. But what is the gender of this pronoun in the KJV? Is it masculine, feminine, or neuter? Do you know your English pronouns? Spirit itself - what is that?
That is neuter, that's a neuter pronoun. So this verse in the KJV seems to be teaching us that the Holy Spirit is not a person, its just a thing, its just a force. This is a misunderstanding of what's going on in the original Greek here. Yes, the pronoun is neuter in Greek, but the reason it's neuter is because the Greek word for Spirit is also neuter. And in Greek, pronouns must agree with their antecedents in gender. And this is just simply grammatical gender, its not saying anything about the person-hood of the Spirit. The rest of scripture is clear that the Holy Spirit is the 3rd person of the trinity and has a mind, has emotions, has a will. We can support that with many different passages that we don't have time to look at. Take my systematic theology classes in the Bible Institute if you wanna study more about these sorts of things.
So in English when we bring the pronoun into English we need to convert it to a masculine because we don't have really grammatical gender in English. We have personal gender in English. And since the Spirit as a person, we know that from scripture, we need to use a masculine pronoun - the Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God's children. That's what the CSB says, and all the other bible translations that I looked at, have the same pronoun there - the word himself or something very similar to it there. They're emphasizing here that the Spirit is not just a thing, a force, something that's impersonal, but is actually a person. So this is a severe miss-interpretation of the original Greek here by the KJV translators.

Here's another verse where I think the KJV has it wrong - Titus 2:13 [verse read]. Notice that the KJV here refers to 2 different individuals, God and Jesus - the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ - 2 different individuals here. But this interpretation is based on a misunderstanding of Greek grammar. I won't get into all the details, we don't have time for that, and it gets pretty technical, but if you want to learn more about the rules of Greek grammar, take my Greek courses in the Bible Institute and eventually we will get to this. So if you're in my Greek class, down the road, we will eventually come along to this rule, its a more advanced rule in Greek grammar. But basically what this rule teaches us is that God and Savior are referring to the same person here. Look at the CSB [verse read].
So this is different, a subtle change, but it's clear that the CSB is seeing the words God and Savior as both pointing to Jesus Christ. And most of the modern bible translations follow this interpretation because it's based on a better understanding of Greek grammar. This verse has one of the strongest proofs for the deity of Jesus in scripture, but if you're using the KJV you will not be able to defend the deity of Christ in this verse, using this verse. You'd go to other places and you could find it there, but not here.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at one more passage and then we'll be finished here. Look at James 3:1-2a [KJV verse read].
This passage actually has 3 different misinterpretations in just a verse and a half here. The first one, let's put up the CSB so we can compare. The CSB says [verse read]. So let's just walk through these differences, the major differences 1 by 1. Notice first of all that the KJV has the word masters, the CSB has the word teachers. The Greek word here just means teachers. So that's a miss-translation in the KJV, it's not talking about masters of slaves, but it's talking about people who teach God's word.
The 2nd problem here is that the king James refers to the greater condemnation. The CSB has a better approach here. It just says a stricter judgment. The word condemnation I think implies the idea of eternal punishment, that we're going to be punished for our sins. That's not what James is saying. The idea of a stricter judgment I think fits well with what scripture teaches elsewhere. It talks about how we're going to stand before the judgment seat of Christ, and we'll be receiving our rewards at that point in time. So the idea is we're not going to be rewarded if we are bad teachers basically. If you try to become a teacher, and God hasn't gifted you for that, and you're doing a bad job teaching, well no rewards for you. And you're going to receive a strict judgment there.
It doesn't mean you're going to be punished for your sins though. The KJV has that implication. Finally at the end here in the beginning of verse 2 we have this phrase in the KJV - in many things we offend all. So it seems to be saying that as Christians we just offend everybody around us, right?

That is not though what the Greek text is saying. The CSB is more accurate here, it just said - we all stumble in many ways. So it's not talking about how we offend other people, its just talking about all we all stumble into sin. No Christian is immune from this, even though we're saved we still sin. And James even says we sin in many ways. The context there is of course focused on our speech, cause James goes on to talk about the tongue here. And that's of course confirmation that we're talking about teachers here, not masters, but teachers. People who speak and teach the word of God. 
So there are 3 different misinterpretations right here in this little short passage in the KJV. And modern translations like the CSB correct those and give us a better understanding.
So the KJV has a lot of warts, and we're actually not even done looking and those warts. Next week we will pick up with the KJV and look at one more set of warts in the KJV and then we'll be done bashing on the KJV. But it's important to be aware of some of the problems in the KJV. Some of those things weren't problems originally but they become problems over time. But some of the things were problems from the beginning, and it was just that the translators were very limited in their understanding, and now we just know better. And so it's better to use up to date translations. I don't recommend the KJV to anybody for multiple reasons - old English and then a lot of bad interpretations. But we can still be thankful that God has used the KJV for the last 400 years despite all these imperfections. God has used it to bring many people to Christ and to help them to grow in their faith. Even people today who still use the KJV - God can use it in their lives despite all its imperfections.

Let's close in prayer. Thank you Lord so much for your word. Thank you for all the different bible translations we have. Thank you for the KJV despite its various imperfections. We know that there is no perfect bible translation, and yet you use these bible translations despite their flaws, despite their inadequacies, because even though there are some mistakes and some errors in them, they're still just packed full of so many important truths. And so we can learn about you and we can learn about your plan for our lives and what you expect from us. So thank you for the way you've used the KJV throughout the years. Thank you for the way you've used it in my life as I was a child learning scripture for the first time. It had a profound impact on my life and I know it's had that impact on many other Christians as well. So we thank you so much for your word Lord. Help us to be motivated to keep growing in our understanding of your word this week. In Jesus' name. Amen.

<h3 id="4a">Review - KJV</h3>


<p class="border1">
We've now spent the last 3 weeks talking about bible translations. And we started with an introduction in the first 2 weeks, where we didn't really get into specific bible translations. But then last week we began to look at the KJV of the bible and we are not done yet. We're going to spend the rest of our time today talking about the king James as well. The KJV was published in the year 1611 and before long it became the most dominant bible translation in English.
And in fact, by the 1700s, just a 100 years or so after it was published, it was basically the only bible translation being used in English. And even today it continues to be used by a great many people. When they check out on bible sales at the different bookstores, and they add up all these totals, usually the KJV comes out somewhere between the 2nd and 4th place. So it's no longer the most popular translation, but it is still top 5 on a regular basis.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the KJV has been updated several times to keep up with changes in the English language. If you've ever read the KJV you know of course that there's a lot of archaic language in there. And if you've ever looked at a page from the original KJV of 1611, then you know it's very difficult to read. Words were spelled differently back then. I put a picture of Genesis 1 up on the screen last week from the original 1611. Its very difficult to read that and so within a short time there were some updates that were made to the KJV. But it has not been revised now since 1769. So coming just past 250 years here. And that means that there are many verses in the KJV that most people use today, that have obsolete or misleading language. I took you through a bunch of examples last week. The KJV has lots of archaic pronouns that people do not use any more today like thou or thee or thy or thyself. It has obsolete words like bewrayeth. We saw the word bewrayeth in a verse last week. Who ever heard of that word before? Well I'm sure it was used 250 years ago, but not anymore. We look at an obsolete phrase like a "strait betwixt two". That's in a very popular passage in Philippines 1 that many people are familiar with. So if you've read the king James in Philippians, you might recognize that phrase the "strait betwixt two". 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem though with some of this language is that words are still used, but they've changed in their meaning. So it's not just that words are obsolete, but words are now misleading. So for example in the KJV we are told that God is terrible. Well 100s of years ago that meant awesome, but now it doesn't mean that any more. Now it means very, very bad. And so that's completely misleading. Anybody reading the bible - we'd never want them to think that God is a very bad God, that he is evil and wicked, that is not true at all. The KJV also says in James 2 - it makes a reference to gay clothing. We looked at that verse last week and now that is a very specific connotation in these days. Well, even 40 or 50 years it had a wildly different connotation. And so more modern translations don't use that word, they have a word like a fine there. It's talking about expensive very nice clothing. And so the language is obsolete, some of it is misleading, but then there are verses the KJV that just have plain old misinterpretation. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we looked last week at how 1 verse in the KJV has Jesus telling his disciples to drink all of the wine during the Lord's supper. And that has led to problems when people take that too far, you know the pastor is thinking - I've got this half pitcher of wine here, I'd better drink all of it, and then he gets drunk. That's not at all what Jesus was talking about there. He was just saying all of you need to drink some of the wine. That is a misinterpretation. There's another verse in the king James that says that a woman is not to usurp authority over a man. The better translation there is that a woman is not to have authority over a man. To usurp authority - well she can have authority as long she's not taking it by force. If the elders of the church grant her that authority, she can preach and she can lead and be a pastor and that sort of thing. That is not what Paul intended in 1 Timothy 2 there. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt4, '00:00', '04:15')">audio</a>
</p>

 

<p class="border1">
Another verse in the KJV says that God will direct our paths with the implication that God's going to show us day by day the specific decisions that he wants us to make. That's not the best translation though. Proverbs 3:6 is really saying God will make our paths straight, has a completely different connotation there. Its just talking about righteous behavior - God is going to help us to live for him and to obey his word when we're depending on him and trusting in him. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another verse in Isaiah 14 has a reference to Lucifer which many people have taken as a reference to Satan. But really there the text is talking about the king of Babylon, it's just calling him a shining star, that's kind of how he viewed himself, as someone who is elevated.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another verse in the king James refers to the Spirit with a neuter pronoun, instead of a masculine pronoun. And so some people have read that and thought - well, the Spirit then is not a person but just a force. That is heresy, that is a denial of the trinity, all 3 persons of the trinity are persons, that's why we refer to them as persons in the trinity.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another verse in the KJV refers to Jesus as simply our Savior, when a more accurate translation is that he is both our God and Savior. That's Titus 2:13. So there's a verse where the KJV fails to teach the deity of Christ when that was what Paul was trying to teach, and the newer translations emphasize that, they called Jesus both God and Savior. So the KJV is certainly not a perfect translation.

<h3 id="4b">Manuscript history</h3>

<p class="border1">
And I want to look at 1 more area today where the KJV is flawed. It has to do with the manuscript support for the KJV. So let's take a minor detour at this point and talk about manuscripts. A manuscript in this context at least, we might talk about somebody sending a manuscript to the publisher for it to be published. But we're using the word in an older sense here. A manuscript is an old document that was written by hand before the printing press was invented. So the word man in there is just referring to how to it would have been written by a person - using the word man there in a generic sense. So a manuscript is just an old document written by hand. And this refers specifically to the era before the printing press was invented in the 1400s. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we do not have the original manuscript for any book of the bible. There is no place, there's no museum that we can walk into and say - aha, there is the original book that Moses wrote called the book of Exodus. Or here is the book of Acts that Luke originally wrote, that he took out his pen and he wrote this. Or we can't go into a library somewhere and find the original book of Ephesians that Paul wrote with his own hand, or that he dictated to the person who wrote it, most likely. None of these original manuscripts has been preserved as far as we know. Maybe there's 1 waiting to be discovered somewhere, but I seriously doubt it. And this should not surprise us because we don't have the original manuscript for any other ancient, famous book. We do not have anything that was personally written by Plato or Aristotle or Socrates or even someone as recent as Shakespeare. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how is it that we can know what all of these people wrote, and how is it possible for us to have a bible and to read if we do not have these original manuscripts? Well, the answer in these cases is that we have later manuscripts that are copies of the original manuscripts. And actually with most ancient documents, we don't even have the direct copies anymore. What we have are copies of copies of copies of copies. Some much later descendants. You know, something was copied, and that was copied, and then that one was copied, and then that one was copied. So we do not know how far back some of our copies go, it's very hard to tell. Some of them probably go quite a ways back maybe, they're the 3rd copy, or the 4th generation copy. But they are copies that is what matters here, we do not have probably even the direct copies of most of these. But we do have copies, that's the important thing. And this is how the words from basically all ancient books have been the preserved. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these days if we want to make a copy of something, we just take it to the trusty old copy machine. Even in your home you probably have a copy machine, we call it a printer. Most printers these days are these all in 1 printers - its got a scanner in it, and so if it has a scanner, it can copy. You just scan it and then it prints a copy of what it just scanned. But at our church here we have a nice big super copy machine that's really fast and efficient and if you took a page my notes here an you ran this through the copy machine and then you compared it to the original, you would have a really hard time telling the difference. These days we even have lots of color copy machines. When I was a kid, there were no color copy machines, they were all black and white. But nowadays we have color copy machines so you can even copy things in color and it's basically a perfect copy, it looks exactly the same as the original, the thing that you were copying. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the printing press was invented in the 1400s, all copies had to be made by hand. And when we compare the copies of a book to each other, what we find is that they basically always disagree with each other, at least to some extent. They may match in many places, or even in most places, but they are not going to match perfectly unless maybe you're looking at a very small copy that maybe just has a verse or 2 on it, something like that. Then maybe you've got a perfect copy, but anything of any significance, of any length, is not going to match any other copy. And this is true for every other ancient book as well. This is simply because nobody is perfect. If you, no matter how careful you are, if you take out your pencil, your pen, and you start making a copy of something else in your possession, you are going to make mistakes eventually. So what I'm telling you is that the bible has not been preserved miraculously. The evidence is super clear, we have all these copies of the bible and they don't agree with each other. There are mistakes in them.

</p>



<h3 id="4c">Generic doctrine of inerrancy</h3>


<p class="border1">
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bible was produced miraculously, I think we have to affirm that. Scripture teaches that the bible is inspired by God. So in other words God used human writers to write down exactly what he wanted them to write. So their words were also his words as well. And he protected them from writing anything that was contrary to fact, that's doctrine of inerrancy.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt4, '10:17', '10:39')">audio</a>
</p>


<h3 id="4d">Doctrine of providence; textual criticism</h3>


<p class="border1">
But I do not see any evidence that God chose to preserve the bible miraculously. And so the 1st way we can know that is because he didn't preserve any of these original manuscripts. They have all been lost, they have all been destroyed. And then secondly he did not protect anyone who copied the bible from making any mistakes. He certainly could have done that, if he had wanted to. That's basically what he did when people were writing scripture - he protected them for making any mistakes. But God instead chose to preserve the bible providentially. What this means is that he used ordinary means instead of super natural means to preserve the bible. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's talk a little about the word providentially. The doctrine of providence just basically means that God is in control of all things. And so he directs everything to fulfill his purposes. So the idea here is just simply that God does not have to intervene miraculously in the world in order to accomplish his purposes. Normally what he does is he just chooses to act behind the scenes in a way that we cannot observe. Its a more subtle way of controlling what is going on here. And that's how he chose to preserve the bible. God used people in all of their weaknesses to copy his word. He did not override their failures in flaws, but he used their weaknesses and their mistakes to preserve his word.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does leave us with a challenge today. Since we do not have any perfect copies of the bible, how is it that we can know what God directed the human authors to write? How can we know what the exact wording was in the original manuscripts of the bible? Well, this is where a branch of scholarship called textual criticism comes into play. Textual criticism is focused on identifying variations in the copies of a book and reconstructing the original text of the book as closely as possible. And this is not just something that's done with the bible, this is done with all ancient documents. Now don't misunderstand me - this phrase textual criticism sound pretty bad, right, sounds negative? But when we practice textual criticism on the bible, we are not adopting a critical attitude toward the bible itself. What we're doing is working at adopting a critical attitude toward the copies of the bible. There's a big difference there.

<h3 id="4e">Generic doctrine of inerrancy continued</h3>

<p class="border1">
The bible itself is perfect. The originals are perfect, we don't have them anymore, but we know that they were perfect.

</p>


<h3 id="4f">Doctrine of providence; textual criticism continued</h3>

<p class="border1">
But these copies of the bible, they have mistakes, there are problems with them. And so our goal needs to be to figure out where are these mistakes in the copies so that we can correct those mistakes, and get back to the original wording of the bible. So ultimately this discipline of textual criticism flows very naturally from having a high view of the bible. If we didn't have a high view of the bible, we wouldn't bother with this practice, we wouldn't really care what the original words of the bible were, and we wouldn't put all this work into trying to figure out what were those original words. But because we have a high view of the bible, cause we believe it's inspired and inerrant, that means that we're gonna do whatever we have to do to reconstruct the original text of the bible. And bible scholars have stayed extremely busy doing this discipline of textual criticism since the 1700s.

</p>


<h3 id="4g">Manuscript flaw 1: schedule pressure from the publisher</h3>


<p class="border1">
And what they have eventually discovered is that the new testament in the KJV is based on inferior manuscript support. The idea here is just that it does not always reflect what was in the original manuscripts. And let's talk a little bit about how this problem arose. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be traced back to a man named Desiderius Erasmus, whom I'll just refer to as Erasmus now, we'll just call him by his last name. That's what we tend to do with famous figures in history - we just call them by their last name. Erasmus was originally trained as a Roman Catholic priest, but he was a brilliant man. And so he ended up going into scholarship, not serving in the day to day activities of a Roman Catholic priest. And Erasmus was so good of a scholar that he ended up having the honor of being the very 1st person to publish a printed Greek new testament. That took place in the year or 1516 - so just 1 year before Martin Luther posted his 95 theses on the door of the chapel there in Wittenberg Germany. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there were some problems with this Greek new testament that Erasmus published. And the 1st one is that he rushed to complete the project. He was in a humongous hurry to finish it. And that's because there was another project already under way to complete a Greek new testament in Spain. Erasmus was working in Switzerland but he was aware of what's going on in Spain. They got the people in Spain working on their new testament - they were working with different publisher than Erasmus was, and Erasmus' publisher wanted desperately to be 1st because he knew that if he could be 1st then they would make a ton of money on this Greek new testament. In fact, as far as we can tell Erasmus' original intent here was only to publish a new Latin bible. That was his original intent here, but the publisher pressured him into including a Greek new testament to go with it. And so this was actually a joint bible - a Latin bible plus a Greek new testament. And so Erasmus gave in to this pressure and he worked on a Greek new testament as well. But this was very much a last minute decision and he had to work at a frantic pace to put together this Greek new testament. I think he ended up finishing it in 6 or 8 months or something like that, and without the aid of a computer or anything like that.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt4, '13:52', '16:10')">audio</a>
</p>




<h3 id="4h">Manuscript flaw 2: small number of late Greek manuscripts used</h3>


<p class="border1">
And so because of this frantic pace that he worked at, this then led to another problem. Because he was rushing to complete this project as a result he had to rely on a small number of late Greek manuscripts here. Because he was working in Switzerland there, he was not going to leave Switzerland, he didn't even leave his city of Basel. Instead he just found whatever manuscripts were right there in his town, and he was able to get his hands on 7 manuscripts. But the oldest of these manuscripts only went back to the 11th century. Most of them were from the 12th century and a few of them were very recent, they were from the 15th century - so just a 100 years old. But none of these manuscripts was really that old. The only went back a couple of 100 years.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt4, '16:08', '16:55')">audio</a>
</p>



<h3 id="4i">Manuscript flaw 3: reliance on the Latin Vulgate</h3>

<p class="border1">
And another problem that took place here is that he also relied on the Latin Vulgate at times. He grew up with the Latin Vulgate, this was viewed as the preeminent bible translation. And so this was authoritative in their minds. And so as he consulted the Greek manuscripts he would sometimes say - you know what, I'm going to follow the Latin Vulgate here instead of my Greek manuscripts. Or there's actually 1 place at the very end of the book of Revelation where Erasmus didn't even have a Greek new testament. Only 1 of these 7 Greek manuscripts had the book of Revelation in it and the last part of that manuscript was missing. So Erasmus did not have the final 6 verses in the book of Revelation in any of the Greek manuscripts that he look at. So what he had to do there is he took his Latin bible, looked at the last 6 verses in Revelation, and translated those into Greek. And that's what he put in his Greek new testament and that led to several errors being introduced in to his Greek new testament because he was not depending on a Greek manuscript at that point.

</p>


<h3 id="4j">Manuscript history continued</h3>

<p class="border1">
Now despite all of these problems with Erasmus' Greek new testament, this new testament ended up having an enormous influence on bible translations. Now he did go on  to fix some of the problems that were in it - there were some really glaring mistakes that crept in there, just dumb things cause he was rushing. So he did make some revisions to it. But these later editions that he published we're not really that much better - some small improvements here in there, but there were still some really severe problems with it. <s>And the 2nd edition was used as the basis for Tyndale's new testament and that had influence on later English translations.</s> Erasmus' 2nd edition of his Greek new testament was used by Luther for his German bible translation. It was the 3rd edition that Tyndale used for his English new testament. And then even after Erasmus died, I think that happened in the 1530's as I recall, then other people just continued to reprint his new testament. And some times there were additional tweaks made, but in general his new testament did not really changed all that much. And after it got proliferated over the next 100 years or so, eventually scholars began calling it the textus receptus. The textus receptus is just simply a Latin phrase that means received text. And so the idea is simply that Erasmus' Greek new testament was widely accepted - that's the idea. Throughout the 1500s and 1600s, this was the standard Greek new testament that was used as the basis for translating the new testament into English bibles and to other languages like Spanish translations as well.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt4, '17:58', '19:34')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Question. Is that for all of the revisions or just the most recent ones? Yeah, different revisions were used in different countries. There was an edition from the mid-1500s used for the basis in Spanish, and then there was a later one used from the 1590s for the KJV. Did it all refer to textus receptus? Yeah, as a group we refer to them as the textus receptus. Yeah, because there's not really that many differences between them. Different people would take his new testament, publish it, and make their own tweaks to it. They didn't have copyright laws back then I guess - nothing like we have today at least. Once the guy's dead you can do whatever you want with his writings. You know, take it and claim it for your own, publish it, make some tweaks to it, make money off of it. So laws have definitely changed a lot since that time. Yeah, the KJV was based on a specific edition of the textus receptus, other translations were based on other editions. But there really weren't that many differences between all these different revisions of Erasmus' Greek new testament. Basically what he started with in the 1st edition with minor changes ended up becoming the received Greek text of the new testament. And the textus receptus has been the standard Greek new testament throughout most of history since that time. It was only during the 1800s that the situation started to change.

<p class="border1">
More and more new testament manuscripts were being discovered in the 1800s and some of these manuscripts that were discovered were very old. And I wanna talk about 2 of the most important ones. They're called Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. Codex Sinaiticus got its name from the fact that it was discovered on mount Sinai. There's a monastery called St Catherine there on mount Sinai and this is where this manuscript was for many years - Codex Sinaiticus.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 1844 there was a German bible scholar name Constantin von Tischendorf who visited this monastery. Tischendorf was on a mission to discover as many ancient manuscripts as he could, of the bible. He was a very diligent bible scholar, very conservative in his views. Most German scholars were very liberal at this point in the 1800s. They thought the bible was full of myths and that kind of stuff. But Tischendorf was conservative still, he believed in the authority and the accuracy of scripture, that it recorded historical events and that drove him to try to find as many ancient manuscripts as he could. And so he just traveled all over the place, visiting libraries and visiting museums and visiting monasteries, any place where there might be this sort of manuscript tucked away, that could end up being very valuable but nobody really understood its value. And so in 1844 he visited this monastery and he was shown this very old looking manuscript and Tischendorf could barely contain his excitement when he got a look at this thing. Cause he knew immediately that this thing was very ancient. Unfortunately though, he was not allowed to examine it at 1st. The people the monastery were very protective of their manuscript.

<p class="border1">
Eventually though after Tischendorf returned a few times he was able to get some time with this manuscript. He got permission to study it in 1859 and eventually he was able to purchase the manuscript for the king of Russia and it was put into a museum in Russia. Today its actually in I think a museum in London, because during world war I, the country of Russia went bankrupt, and the Brits decide - hey let's buy this manuscript, we'll take advantage of the Russians during their time of need here. And they were able to purchase the Codex Sinaiticus for a pretty nice price. So I think it's still in the London museum today. So you could go visit it if you're ever in London. You can also see online - there's scans of it, you can look at it online, but there's something special about seeing something really old in person. And this is a very old manuscript. It includes the entire new testament plus the Septuagint for the old testament as well, but the new testament is what really counts here.  And this manuscript has been dated all the way back to the 4th century, so roughly about 350, some where in there. Can't be exactly certain when it was copied, but they can look at the type of paper that was used, the writing style that was used, the type of ink that was used, and they can pinpoint it somewhere in the 4th century. So this manuscript is far older than any of the manuscripts that Erasmus used to publish his Greek new testament.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt4, '22:27', '23:48')">audio</a>

<p class="border1">
Let's talk about Codex Vaticanus. I think you can probably figure out where this got it's name from, right? Where do you think this is being stored? (students: Vatican). Yeah, in the Vatican. The library at the Vatican has held this manuscript since at least 1475. That's when we have the earliest record of it being stored in the Vatican city there. Unfortunately for 100s of years, the Roman Catholic church would not let anyone even have a look at it - they were so protective of it.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But finally in the 1800s the Catholics started allowing scholars to study this manuscript. And thankfully they did decide to publish the text of this manuscript. So somebody took the manuscript and put it into typeset and then printed it. And this took place in 1857. Unfortunately, that first publication had tons and tons of errors in it - it just wasn't really usable. And so it took several more editions of it, and finally in 1867 there was a very reliable publication of this manuscript that reflected very closely what was recorded in it. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no surprise, Tischendorf was the one to publish that copy of Codex Vaticanus. And so that would have just been a couple years after he published Codex Sinaiticus. Tischendorf I think was the most important bible scholar of the 1800s, just simply because of his diligence in publishing all of these old manuscripts.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Codex Vaticanus does not contain the entire new testament, but it does have most of it. It's just missing a couple of books, I think it's missing Revelation, and a couple Paul's letters, and then part of Hebrews. But it does have over I would say 90% of the new testament. And most bible scholars think that Vaticanus is even older than Sinaiticus. So we dated Sinaiticus to the 4th century, Vaticanus is also coming from the 4th century but most scholars think it's even a little bit older. So maybe 325, somewhere around there, maybe 25 years older, or so. Again its hard to be certain, but probably from the early 4th century whereas Codex Sinaiticus is probably from the middle of the 4th century. So these documents are 2 of the most important new testament manuscripts in existence. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have discovered even older manuscripts of the new testament since that time. In the 1900s there have been many smaller fragments discovered as well but none of them is even close to having the entire new testament. Most of them just have a couple of books of the new testament, some even just have 1 book. There are some fragments that are so small they just have a couple of verses. Our oldest new testament manuscript has just 5 verses from the gospel of John, chapter 18. That manuscript has been dated into the early 2nd century so roughly 125. That's about 30 or 40 years after John wrote his gospel. So that is an extremely early copy of John's gospel, a short as it might be.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what it proves is that book was not written in the late 2nd century like many liberal scholars thought during the 1800s. Now everybody has to acknowledge - okay this was written no later than early 2nd century. The liberals of course still don't think John wrote it, but they have to date it early at least, back to the early 2nd century, which I think is wrong. John wrote this - end of the 1st century and this is strong support for that view. My point here is just simply that the discovery of these very old manuscripts completely revolutionized the study of the new testament. And by the end of the 1800s, bible scholars could see very clearly that the new testament of the KJV was significantly flawed.

<p class="border1">
And so was time for a new bible translation to be published. And it was called the revised version. Its called a revised version because it was just simply a revision of the KJV. It was first published in 1881, just the new testament, and then 4 years later they finished the rest of the bible, the old testament was published alongside of the new testament there in 1885. That's a practice that continues today. Pretty much all bibles published today go through stages, the new testament first and then the old testament gets added to it later. It just seems to be what they do. It takes a long to translate the bible and they don't want to just wait till the end, but they want to give you a little taste of it, give you the new testament to look at, maybe the Psalms and the Proverbs, and then eventually they'll get around to the rest of the bible as well.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt4, '27:15', '27:59')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Now this revised version here was not based on the textus receptus, on Erasmus' Greek new testament. Instead, it was based on a brand new Greek new testament that was published in 1881 - it came out just 5 days before the revised version. Obviously the translators of the revised version had access to it before it was published. But this Greek new testament was published by 2 famous British scholars. Their names are, I wanna give you the first names too, Brooke Westcott and Fenton Hort, but we just call them Westcott and Hort. These 2 men worked on this Greek new testament, they also worked on the translation as well, the revised version. So that's how the translators of the revised version had access to their work, cause these guys were working on both projects here. And what these 2 men did was they relied heavily on these 2 important old manuscripts - Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. Unfortunately though, the revised version was very British. It had a very British sound to it, they used a lot of words that were only used in British English. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so this translation was just not popular in the United States. And so eventually some Americans scholars took the revised version and they tweaked it so that it was more suitable for Americans. And this translation was a appropriately called the American Standard Version (ASV). It was first published in 1900 with just the new testament. And then the whole bible was published just a year later in 1901. It didn't take them long because they had the revised version as their starting point. They basically just went through it, looked for anything that was too British, and changed it to be American. That's not too hard to do, right? So this was just basically a revision of the revised version using an American English.

<h3 id="4k">KJV manuscript flaws; verse comparisons between KJV and ASV</h3>

<p class="border1">
Now I'm not going to give you a more detailed analysis of these two translations - the revised version and the ASV, because these are not used anymore today. You can still find them if you search online and look at them, but nobody's carrying around a revised version or an ASV, or very few people are at least. And the reason is simply that there are newer bible translation that have revised these translations. And we'll get to them eventually, we'll start looking at them next week. But before we do that, I do want to show you now some of the differences between the KJV and the ASV.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll focus on the ASV since we are Americans and we know American English better. Its still older English cause its over 100 years old. But we can handle the ASV better then we can the revised version. So I want to show you some of these differences. There are some significant differences between the KJV and the ASV because they are based on different Greek new testaments. The KJV was based on the textus receptus, Erasmus' Greek new testament, while the ASV was based on this new testament done by Westcott and Hort. And there were many differences between them, and we can observe these differences in the translations themselves.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The KJV is just based on these later manuscripts from the 11th century to the 15th century. The ASV is based on a whole wide variety of manuscripts, but then the Greek new testament focuses on the oldest ones and gives more preference to those. So the ASV is going to often follow Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, even when it disagrees, when these 2 manuscripts disagree with a bunch of the later copies because those later copies are not as reliable as these older ones, that are so close to the originals.

<p class="border1">
So let's start our comparisons here by looking at John's gospel. John 5:3-4 has a very interesting passage. Here is the KJV [verse read]. This passage is describing a pool in the city of Jerusalem that Jesus visited here in this chapter. It was called the pool of Bethesda. And Jesus ended up healing a man here who was sick and waiting by this pool. But now let's look at this passage in the ASV [verse read]. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's it, there's nothing more here. What is going on, why does the ASV have such a small amount of text here? There's not even anything here for verse 4. The end of verse 3 is also missing, so they have half of verse 3 from the KJV and nothing for verse 4 at all. Well the reason the ASV is missing so much here, is that they're following these oldest Greek manuscripts. Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus do not have anything there for verse 4 or for the end of verse 3. These statements are only found in much later manuscripts, the ones that are not very old.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some of the manuscripts that we have do have this these statements here, from the end of verse 3 & 4, but then they put like an asterisk in the margin. And what that indicates is that they're not sure, the copiers were not sure if the statements were really authentic, if John actually wrote these or not. But they're putting them in just to be safe, you can say, 'cause they didn't want to skip over anything that John might have written. But they were questioning whether they were original.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the translators of the ASV were I think completely justified in skipping over these statements that were in the KJV here. They do include the rest of verse 3 and verse 4 in a footnote, but not in the main text, because they could not find anything in the oldest Greek manuscripts here. You have to fast forward to much later manuscripts before you start to see these statements. And so I think its safe to conclude these statements were not written by the apostle John. It would seem that somebody down the road thought - well there needs to be more here, this isn't a good, what's going on here with this water, why are all these people lying next to the water. So they added an explanation for why they think the people were there. And maybe somebody just wrote it in the margin at first thinking - oh maybe this is what happened and somebody later thought - maybe this is what really happened and they skipped over this, and it should have been included. So I think probably accidentally it got added in at some point and it wasn't that somebody deliberately said - oh, I'm going to add my own scripture here. No, I think it probably got put in a margin of a manuscript first and later it got included in the actual text. But there aren't really any good reasons for thinking John wrote this passage here because our earliest manuscripts that have this are not very old all that.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at another passage now where there is a big difference between these 2 translations - the king James and the ASV. Look at Acts 9:5-6. This is the KJV here and this is giving us an interaction between Paul and Jesus. Remember how Paul was blinded on the road to Damascus by a bright light then Jesus spoke to him? So this is their interaction here [verse read]. Now, look at this passage in the ASV [verse read]. Once again you can see how much shorter the ASV here is compared to the KJV. We do have something for both verses 5 & 6 in the ASV, but there's a whole statement right in the middle of this that is completely skipped over in the ASV. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the reason that this part right in the middle is not included is because it is not found in any Greek new testament manuscripts for this passage. There is not a single copy of the new testament in Greek that has the statement in the middle of this passage. So how did did it get into the KJV? Well remember what I told you earlier about how Erasmus' sometimes used the Latin Vulgate when he was putting together his Greek new testament? That's what he did here. All the manuscripts that he had from Greek did not have that part in the middle, but he knew Latin, he was consulting the Latin as well, and he decided - you know what, I'm going to take this stuff here that's in the Latin bible and put it into Greek. So he translated from Latin into Greek and included it here right in the middle of this passage. But to this day we have never discovered any copy of the book of Acts, that in Greek, has a corresponding statement here, for what we see in the KJV here.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we might wonder - well how did the Latin Vulgate end up including this stuff here in the middle? Well I don't think it's too hard to figure it out. Paul referred back to his conversion experience later in the book of Acts. Remember how he was sharing his testimony before the Jewish people who were before him - who got mad at him? He asked to speak to them, and he recorded for them - hey, here's what happened to me on the road to Damascus. Then later he appears before king Agrippa, he talks to him about his testimony. So we have Paul himself talking about what happened to him on the road to Damascus. And he includes the stuff here that's in the middle of this passage.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no contradiction here. Luke just chose not to include these details when he recorded the event in Acts 9. There is no contradiction here. I'm sure that the people copying the book of Acts in Latin thought - oh, there's a contradiction here, we need to fix this and get this all reconciled and harmonize these passages. No, there is no problem here. Just because you skip over something doesn't mean that you're trying to contradict it. It just means that you're not going into that level of detail. So there is no contradiction here. Paul was just sharing details later in the book of Acts that Luke chose not to include here. Maybe he chose not to include them because he knew he was going to include them later and he didn't feel like adding more space to his book, right? Its hard to put a long book on to a scroll and he's thinking - I'll just write about that stuff later cause I know know Paul talked about when he recounted his testimony. So I'll just give the bare bones here. I think the ASV is completely justified in leaving that out cause its not found in any Greek new testament manuscript.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at another difference between these 2 translations - 1 Corinthians 6:20. Look at the KJV here [verse read]. Now look at this verse in the ASV [verse read].
Notice that the end of the KJV is missing. There's no reference to your spirit or to how they belong to God here in the ASV. They're just skipping over the end of this verse here.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once again what they're doing is just relying on the oldest manuscripts, the Codex Vaticanus, Codex Sinaiticus, other old manuscripts. They do not have this statement at the end of the verse. Our oldest copy of 1 Corinthians is dated to the year 200. It includes a portion of Paul's letters, so it's nowhere near the whole new testament, but it has a portion of Paul's letters. And even going back to the year 200, we can see this statement was not there. So we know that Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus were reliable in preserving what Paul originally wrote here. It's very unlikely that Paul wrote a statement here that we have at the end of the verse here - in your spirit, which are God's. I think probably somebody copying this letter just thought - well this is kind of an abrupt ending here, we can't just leave people hanging like this, lets make this a little more well rounded and add an additional thoughts. And perhaps it just got put in the margin at first, kind of as a little devotional thought, and then eventually got added into the text of a later manuscript. But Paul did not originally write this statement, there would no reason for him to talk about our spirits here, because the whole context there is focused on sin that we do with our bodies, sexual immorality. So it makes perfect sense that he would have a very sharp abrupt ending here focused on the sin done in our body and how we need to glorify God with our body.

</table>

<p class="border1">
Let's look another example, let's got forward to 1 John 3:1. Look at the KJV here [verse read]. Now look at this verse in the ASV. I'll give you a heads up, it's gonna look very similar to the KJV, but look carefully and see if you can see the change here [verse read]. Obviously, there are little bitty tweaks in here, but there is a phrase here that's in 1 translation that's not in the other, a significant phrase, can you find it? Is the additional phrase in the KJV or the ASV? Up to this point we've been seeing that the ASV shortens the KJV - that is not the case here. The ASV is longer. What is the extra little statement in the ASV? (student: and such we are.) And such we are, its just kind of tucked away right in the middle of this verse.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again the translators of the ASV, all they were doing was just following the oldest manuscripts that they had, Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, and many other old Greek manuscripts of the new testament. They include this little statement right here in the middle of this verse. And the ASV is just following the evidence here. I think probably what happened here with the later copies is that maybe somebody just overlooked that little statement, its so brief right, its only 2 words in the original Greek, it would be very easy just to jump right over it and skip it accidentally. Or perhaps somebody thought - oh, somebody added this, it is kind of superfluous, why would John say this, and so maybe then they thought - well, this must be a mistake here and they took it out with good intentions, I would suspect. But the evidence is strongly on the side for including the statement.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is one of places were the KJV is actually missing part of scripture. A lot of times its just adding things that weren't really in scripture, but here they're actually missing something that was originally written. And I think this probably just reflects John's excitement here, he's so excited at the thought of being called a child of God that he just overflowed with emotion here and said "and such we are, we are God's children!". So this is just I think John emphasizing his excitement here about this wonderful truth.

<p class="border1">
Now let's look at another significant difference here. And we're not even going to leave the letter that were in, we're just going to go forward 2 chapters to 1 John 5. Look at verses 7 and 8 in the KJV [verse read]. So this time we're back to what we were doing earlier, right? Let's read the ASV [verse read]. So the ASV s shorter here than the king James. Right in the middle of this we have an extra statement included, its actually more toward the beginning there, and there's an extra statement here in the king James that is not found in the ASV.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once again the ASV translators are just following the evidence. There are only 8 Greek new testament manuscripts out of the 100s that we have that include this statement that's missing in the ASV. And half of those 8 manuscripts, 4 of them, are only including it with a little signal like an asterisk to show  - hey, we kind of doubt that this is actually part of John's original letter. And the oldest manuscript that has this passage comes from the 10th century. So for the first 9 centuries here when John's first letter was copied, there was nothing there referenced about the 3 in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. There was no trinitarian statement here in this passage. I suspect what happened was somebody later on was copying this and thought - oh, this is cool, there's these 3 who bear witness, the Spirit, the water, and the blood - that's kind of like the trinity, it reminds you of the trinity - the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. And they probably just added a devotional comment in the margin just reflecting on that wonderful truth. But somebody else came along later and said - oh, they must've forgotten to add this, they skipped over it, and they're telling us make sure you include this. And it was just a misunderstanding. So eventually this got thrown in there and added to the Greek manuscript.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now certainly, I'm not going to stand here before you and say that the statement itself is not true. Certainly we do have 3-in-1: Father, Son, Holy Spirit, right? The question is not whether it's a true statement. The trinity is taught throughout scripture. The question here is whether John wrote this. Was John trying to teach about the trinity right here in 1 John 5:7-8.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the answer quite clearly is no, because for 900 years there were no copies of 1 John that had this statement in Greek. We have to fast forward much later before we see it. The other really strong evidence I think for this, is if you survey the writings of early church leaders, who debated the trinity vigorously by the way - they never once refer to this statement here, never once. That would be non-sense for them to argue about the trinity and never refer to this passage if they knew about it. They did not know about it, and that's because it wasn't there. That's how we know, that's really the strongest evidence that this is not part of John's first letter.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at one final difference between these 2 translations - the KJV and the ASV. Let's look at the last book of the bible, Revelation 22:19. Here's the KJV [verse read]. Alright now let's look at the ASV here [verse read]. Now these 2 verses are very similar here. The difference really just comes down to 1 word, so this is even harder to see than the difference in 1 John 3:1. But can anybody see it? It's somewhere in the middle here? Can anybody see the 1 word that's been changed here? (student: tree & book). Book and tree, yes. The KJV has "book of life", the ASV refers to the "tree of life" here.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason the ASV changed the king James here, is because as we saw with one of our earlier examples, Acts 9, there is not a single Greek new testament manuscript that has the Greek word for book here, in the middle of this verse. They do have the word book at the end of the verse of course, that are written in this book. But in the middle of the verse, when we refer to this of life idea, is it book of life or tree of life? Well, every copy in a Greek manuscript of Revelation, they all have the Greek word for tree here. Not a single one has the Greek word for book.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened here? Well once again this is coming from the Latin Vulgate. Remember how I told you earlier that Erasmus didn't have a Greek manuscript that had the last few verses in Revelation? This is one last few verses in Revelation. The book has 22 chapters, I think it only has 20 or 21 verses. So this was included, this is one of the places where he had to take his Latin Vulgate and translate the Latin into Greek. And the Latin Vulgate was wrong here. It had the phrase in Latin, the equivalent in Latin, book of life instead of tree of life. And it is not hard at all to see how the mistake crept into the Latin Vulgate. The Latin words for tree and book are extremely similar. They're very different in our language, but in Latin the word for book is Libro from which we get our library. And the Latin word for tree is ligno. libro-ligno: it not hard to see how people would get those confused, right? There's only a couple letters difference there, they sound very similar. So its very, very easy to see how a mistake would've been made there. But it was wrong, it doesn't say book of life, it says tree of life. Certainly we do have a reference to the book of life earlier in the book of Revelation. But here we're talking about the tree of life, not the book of life.

<h3 id="4l">king James only view</h3>

<p class="border1">
So the ASV was a major improvement on the KJV. It was based on much better manuscript support. And all that significant places where there's a difference between the ASV and the KJV in the new testament, the ASV is going to be better, because its relying on a whole host of Greek manuscripts for the new testament. Especially these really old manuscripts like Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ASV unfortunately never challenged the popularity of the KJV. The KJV continued to be the dominant translation in English. In fact, many people criticized the ASV for these different changes that were made in the translation. And some of them would even go on to argue for a position that we now call the king James only view. This view is still widely held today by many people who claim to be Christians. These people believe that the KJV is perfect and so its therefore wrong to make any changes to it - don't you dare try to make a revision of the KJV. This translation is perfect. The ASV then, any place where it differs from the KJV would be wrong. And one of the arguments that they use, perhaps the major argument that they use, is that God in his providence has chosen to preserve his word in the KJV.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument though fails on a number of levels. God didn't just preserve his word in the KJV, he preserved it in many other translations as well throughout history, and he preserved it through thousands of manuscripts in various languages, especially in Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic, the original languages of the bible. So why should we think that the KJV is so special? Now the response from king James only advocates is that the KJV was the dominant translation in English for hundreds of years. But this is logically fallacious. The Latin Vulgate was the dominant translation in the world for 1000 years, much longer than the KJV. So we can make that same argument for the Latin Vulgate, and it would be a much stronger argument. We can even make that argument for the Greek Septuagint, the very first translation of the bible. It was not dominant for as long as the Vulgate, but this was the very first translation, so why not make the argument for the Septuagint?
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are some problems with this argument. And what basically seems to be going on is these people are almost assuming that God has only chosen to preserve his word in English. You know, that's a little of a bit of an ethnocentric argument, a bit racist you could say. So here are some responses that I would give to people hold the king James only view.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt4, '48:19', '50:53')">audio</a>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>What about people who lived before the KJV was published? How did they have access to God's preserved word? I suppose someone could argue that the KJV was very similar to the earlier English translations, but they weren't exactly the same. And so before the KJV was published, no one had access the God's perfect word. And that would be then for 100s and 100s of years after the bible was really finished. So this - I think this line of questioning can help expose the problems with this view. <a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt4, '50:53', '51:22')">audio</a></li>
	<li>We can also respond by saying what about people who don't understand English? How can they have access to God's preserved word? Should we really expect everybody in the world to learn English so that they can read God's perfect word? That is actually what some people believe unfortunately. But it's really just nonsense. English didn't even exist as a language when scripture was completed. People can read God's word in a variety of languages, and if they really wanna be the most precise they should go back to the original Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. You don't need to know English to get a precise understanding of God's word. <a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt4, '51:22', '51:55')">audio</a></li>
	<li>A 3rd response I would give is that God in his providence has chosen to allow many bad things to take place. And these things do not meet with God's approval simply because they fall under his providence. God's providence includes everything that happens, that includes sin as well. And so God's providence does not imply that he endorses the errors in the KJV. As we said earlier, the scripture has been preserved providentially, not miraculously. And so there are many errors that have come into our different copies of bible through the years. God's expecting us to come to his word with our brains turned on and try to figure out where are these mistakes, and how can we fix these? And many bible scholars have put in just hours and hours of labor for us to help us with that issue here. <a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt4, '51:50', '52:37')">audio</a></li>
</ul>

Now the king James only advocates do use other arguments, but we basically dealt with them already. king James only advocates argue that later translations subtract from God's word, because most of the later translations have fewer words then the KJV, as we saw many of them or subtracting statements. But of course as we've already seen, what's really going on here is the KJV is adding to God's word. And scripture prohibits both subtracting from God's word and adding to God's word as well, we should not do either one.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king James advocates also argue that later translations deny important doctrines like the trinity - hey you took the trinity out of 1 John 5, you're denying the trinity. Not at all, just removing one statement of a doctrine in scripture doesn't mean we're denying that doctrine. All we're saying is that doctrine is not taught in that particular passage, its taught in other places, but not right here. And besides there are places in the KJV where the deity of Christ is not taught when it actually is taught in the original Greek. Titus 2:13 is one example of that. So the king James only view really just involves a complete distortion of the doctrine of scripture. Its completely ignoring the facts of history and the clear evidence of how God has preserved his word through time.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now certainly God has used the KJV despite all of its many flaws, we've looked at them in pretty good detail now. And there are much better translations for us to use today and we should make use of them. And so I do not recommend the KJV for people to use today. God has used it through time, God can still use it today, but my main reason for rejecting it and not recommending it is that there are just simply so many newer translations that are much, much better than the KJV. So there's nothing wrong with using it and reading it if you'd like to, but it is definitely not one of the best choices available, its not a heretical bible or anything like that, doesn't have heresy in it, but it is not an accurate translation of the bible in many places. So as we dig into newer translations starting next week, I'll be able to give you some translations that I can recommend.

<h3 id="4m">closing prayer - part 4</h3>

<p class="border1">
Let's close in prayer. Thank you Lord for your word. Thank you for preserving it. Thank you for giving as many translations of the bible as imperfect as they might be, especially older bible translations. But thank you Lord that you use those translations. And thank you that we have such wonderful newer translations today that are so accurate, and if they do have any mistakes, they're just so few and far between because of the diligent labors of bible scholars. So we thank you Lord for your word. And I pray that you'd motivate us as we study about bible translations, to dig into your word more and more. In Jesus name. Amen.
