<p>Summary: The KJV was good for a long time, supreme for hundreds of years, still popular, and something to be thankful for.  There are some memorable / popular verses to remember. But there are better translations for people today. There are places the KJV should have stuck with the Tyndale translation. There are some obsolete words. Also, some words changed meaning over time - more serious problem. And there are manuscript flaws.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

The earliest translations included the Septuagint (2nd & 3rd centuries / Greek bible) and Vulgate (Latin) which was supreme for over 1,000 years.
Two events facilitated change from the Vulgate - 1) the printing press and 2) reformation. The reformation sparked an explosion of new translations that were supported by printing press. Tyndale began to translate the first English bible 1526, but was put to death. Other men finished the work.

In 1603 King James in England authorized a new translation (KJV). He was enthusiastic about the project - his legacy. 40-50 years later the KJV became the most popular (dominant). After 100 years, by the 1700's, it was the only English translation being used. Even today, it comes in the top 5. It has been updated several times. But it has not been revised since 1769. The KJV of today is different than the original of 1611 in about 100,000 places. Most of these differences have to do with changes in spelling and punctuation. A Gothic font also changed.


<h3>Memorable / popular verses in the 1769 version</h3>
Some of the most memorable/popular verses ...
<ul>
	<li>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path (Psalm 119:105 KJV)</li>
	<li>But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. (Isaiah 40:31 KJV)</li>
	<li>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you (Matthew 6:33 KJV)</li>
	<li>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16 KJV)</li>
</ul>

<p>The translators of the KJV didn't start from scratch, but built from previous versions. 90% was from Tyndale's New Testament</p>
<ul>
	<li>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God (Matthew 5:9 KJV). This was taken word from word from Tyndale. Tyndale made up the word peacemaker, which didn't exist before.</li>
	<li>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you (Matthew 7:7 KJV). This was also copied from Tyndale</li>
	<li>For in him we live, and move, and have our being (Acts 17:28a). Comes word from word from Tyndale, except the KJV added one word.</li>
	<li>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. (Romans 13:1 KJV). Part of this verse was copied from Tyndale. And the phrase "the powers that be" was coined by Tyndale.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tyndale did such a good job in his translation that it impacted everyone for 100's of years.</p>
<h2 id="02">A few places the KJV should have stuck with Tyndale</h2>

Some verses have plain misinterpretations - some examples follow.

<p>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; (Matthew 26:27 KJV). The verse says to drink all of the wine. In one church the preacher drank all the wine and got drunk, basing his effort on the verse. Compare this to other translations.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>And he toke the cup and thanked and gave it them sayinge: drinke of it every one (Matthew 26:27 TYN)</li>
		<li>Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them and said, "Drink from it, all of you. (Matthew 26:27 CSB)</li>
	</ul>


<p>If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. (1 Cor 14:27 KJV). Bibles that display italics show words not taken from the Greek. The word 'unknown' is in italics in a bible that retained italics, and the problem was that the word implies an issue with real / actual languages like in Acts 2. Both passages are talking about real languages so the word 'unknown' causes confusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>If eny man speake wt tonges let it be two at once or at the most thre at once and that by course: and let another interprete it. (1 Cor 14:27 TYN)</li>
<li>If anyone speaks in a tongue, there are to be only two, or at the most three, each in turn, and let someone interpret. (1 Cor 14:27 CSB)</li>
</ul>


<p>But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence (1 Timothy 2:12 KJV). The word usurp means taking by force, implying it is OK if not by force.</p>
<ul>

<li>I suffre not a woman to teache nether to have auctoricie over a man: but forto be in silence (1 Timothy 2:12 TYN)</li>
<li>I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; instead, she is to remain quiet. (1 Timothy 2:12 CSB)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="03">Obsolete language</h2>


The English language has changed since 1769, causing obsolete [words] language. For example, thou, thee thine, and thyself are not used any more. Also, words [phrases] like bewrayeth  / betwixt to are not used. A few examples follow but dozens of examples are possible.

<ul>
<li>Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not. (Proverbs 29:24 KJV). Bewrayeth is an old word that means to reveal.</li>
<li>To be a thief's partner is to hate oneself; he hears the curse but will not testify. (Proverbs 29:24 CSB)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever (Jeremiah 17:4 KJV). The old pronouns are obsolete</li>
<li>You will, on your own, relinquish your inheritance that I gave you. I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have set my anger on fire; it will burn forever. (Jeremiah 17:4 CSB)</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better. (Philippians 1:23 KJV). betwixt is no longer used.</li>
<li>I am torn between the two. I long to depart and be with Christ-which is far better- (Philippians 1:23 CSB)</li>
</ul>


[The copyist adds that at least one spell checker's default set of known words doesn't have many of the obsolete words.]
<h2 id="04">Some words changed meaning over time</h2>

<p>Words changing meaning over time is a more serious problem than obsolete words.</p>

<p>terrible versus awesome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thou halt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible (Deuteronomy 7:21 KJV). In the past, the word terrible meant awesome.</li>
<li>Don't be terrified of them, for the LORD your God, a great and awesome God, is among you. (Deuteronomy 7:21 CSB)</li>
</ul>


<p>gay versus fine:</p> 
<ul>
<li>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool (James 2:3 KJV). The word gay used to mean happy, bright, or cheerful - different than what it means today.</li>
<li>If you look with favor on the one wearing the fine clothes and say, "Sit here in a good place," and yet you say to the poor person, "Stand over there," or "Sit here on the floor by my footstool," (James 2:3 CSB)</li>
</ul>

<p>holy and conversation:</p>
<ul>
<li>But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; (1 Peter 1:15 KJV) The word holy meant conduct / behavior back then, and the word conversation now has a more narrow meaning that misleads the reader.</li>
<li>But as the one who called you is holy, you also are to be holy in all your conduct; (1 Peter 1:15 CSB)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some clear misinterpretations in the KJV. Scholars have improved the ability to interpret. KJV misinterpretations that might have been known back then.</p>

<p>God will direct our paths doesn't mean showing decisions day by day. The meaning is more that he helps us to live righteously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths (Proverbs 3:5-6 KJV). It sounds like God will direct a lot of details like who to marry or where to live while trusting in him. Christians have used the verse for detailed decisions, but the passage is not talking about decisions. We shouldn't expect God to show us exact details that would take away freedom.</li>
<li>Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding; in all your ways know him, and he will make your paths straight (Proverbs 3:5-6 CSB). The CSB says that while trusting in the LORD he will enable us to live righteously.</li>
</ul>


<p>Satan versus king of Babylon:</p>
<ul>
<li>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! (Isaiah 14:12 KJV). The word Lucifer is just a transliteration from the Latin Vulgate, but in Latin the word Lucifer just means a shining star. Later people misunderstoodd it as a name. The verse is not referring to Satan, mostly the king of Babylon. The king of Babylon probably thought of himself as a god, thus the phrase about fallen from heaven.</li>
<li>Shining morning star, how you have fallen from the heavens! You destroyer of nations, you have been cut down to the ground. (Isaiah 14:12 CSB)</li>
</ul>


<p>Pronouns:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: (Romans 8:16 KJV). "Spirit itself" is a neuter pronoun, which teaches the Holy Spirit is not a person. The Holy Spirit is the 3rd person of the trinity so a masculine pronoun is used in the CSB. A severe misinterpretation.</li>
<li>The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God's children, (Romans 8:16 CSB)</li>
</ul>


<p>deity of Christ</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; (Titus 2:13 KJV). The separation of God and Savior fails to teach the deity of Christ.</li>
<li>while we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. (Titus 2:13 CSB) It implies God and Savior are the same reference.</li>
</ul>


<p>masters versus teachers:</p>

<ul>
<li>My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. For in many things we offend all (James 3:1-2a). Three misinterpretations: The KJV has masters where CSB has teachers. KJV refers to greater condemnation whereas CSB has stricter judgment. The KJV implies bad teachers will be punished for sins. The KJV says we offend all people whereas the CSB just says individual stumble.</li>
<li>Not many should become teachers, my brothers, because you know that we will receive a stricter judgment. For we all stumble in many ways. (James 3:1-2a CSB)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="05">manuscript flaws</h2>


<p>One more area where the KJV is flawed is in the manuscripts.</p>

<p>A manuscript is an old document that was written by hand before invention of the printing press. We don't have the original manuscript for any book of the bible. There is no museum where we can find an original from Moses, Acts, Luke, or Ephesians from Paul. Maybe one is waiting to be discovered but that is doubtful. Also, there is no original for Plato, Socrates, and Shakespeare. We have later manuscripts that are copies.</p>

<p>Today a copy machine usually makes copies and it is fast and the copy and original look almost the same. The copy machine does well even with color. But before the printing press, copies had to be done by hand, and we find they disagreed in some places when the length was significant. This is true for any ancient book as well because no one is perfect. So the Bible has not been preserved miraculously [though it was produced miraculously]. All the [original] manuscripts were [assumed to be] destroyed. Also, God did not protect the copyist from making mistakes. So the Bible has not been preserved miraculously. Instead God chose to preserve the Bible providentially. In other words, he used ordinary means instead of supernatural means to preserve the Bible.</p>

<p>So how can we know what the exact wording was in the original manuscripts of the Bible? A branch of scholarship called textual criticism analyzes this. Textual criticism is focused on identifying variations in the copies of a book and reconstructing the original as closely as possible.</p>

<p>The New Testament in the King James Version is based on inferior manuscript support (specifically in the new testament). This problem can be traced back to a man named Desiderius Erasmus, who was a Roman Catholic priest. He had the honor of being the first person to publish a printed Greek New Testament in 1516. But he rushed to complete the project, and as a result he had to rely on a small number of late Greek manuscripts. He used only seven manuscripts, and the oldest one was from the 11th century. He also relied on the Latin Vulgate instead of the Greek at times.</p>

<p>Erasmus's Greek New Testament was revised and reprinted many times and later known as the Textus Receptus, which is a Latin phrase that means "Received Text." It was widely accepted [in the] 1500s and 1600s, and so it was the basis for all the early English Bible translations, including the King James Version. But in the 1800s many New Testament manuscripts were discovered, and some of them were very old. The two most important ones are called Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. So a new translation of the Bible was published in 1881 (New Testament) and 1885 (whole Bible). It was called the Revised Version because it was a revision of the King James Version. It was not based on the Textus Receptus but a Greek New Testament published by two British scholars named Westcott and Hort. It was based heavily on Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. Then the American Standard Version was published in 1900 (New Testament) and 1901 (whole Bible). It was a revision of the Revised Version using American English.</p>


<p>Here are some of the most significant differences between the KJV and the ASV:</p>
<ul>
<li>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. (John 5:3 - 4 KJV).</li>
<li>In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered (John 5:3-4 ASV).</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. (Acts 9:5-6 KJV)</li>
<li>And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: but rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. (Acts 9:5-6 ASV).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. (1 Corinthians 6:20 KJV)</li>
<li>For ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body. (1 Corinthians 6:20 ASV).</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. (1 John 3:1 KJV)</li>
<li>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and such we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. (1 John 3:1 ASV)</li>
</ul>

<p>1 Jn 5:7-8 seems to support the Trinity, but the earlier manuscripts didn't have that - it was probably added later. Maybe someone put a devotional remark and someone included that later:</p>
<ul>
<li>For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. (1 John 5:7-8 KJV)</li>
<li>And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one. (1 John 5:7-8 ASV)</li>
</ul>


<p>
The Greek does not have book of life in Rev 22:19: book of life, but tree of life. The Vulgate had book of life and the KJV followed the mistake. There are other verses too:</p>
<ul>
<li>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. (Revelation 22:19 KJV)</li>
<li>and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book. (Revelation 22:19 ASV)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="06">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So the ASV was a major improvement on the KJV because it was based on better manuscript support. But many people criticized the ASV for the changes that were made. Some of them even argued for a position called the King James Only view, and this view is still held by people today. They believe that the KJV is perfect and that it's wrong to make any changes to it. They argue that God in his providence has chosen to preserve his Word in the KJV.</p>

<p>Here are some responses to the King James Only view:</p>
<ul>
<li>What about people who lived before the KJV was published? How did they have access to God's preserved Word?</li>
<li>What about people who don't understand English? How can they have access to God's preserved Word?</li>
<li>God in his providence has chosen to allow many bad things to take place. They do not meet with his approval simply because they fall under his providence. So God's providence does not imply that he endorses the errors in the KJV.</li>
</p>

<p>The KJV is not recommended for people to use today. There are currently much better translations available for us to use.</p>
