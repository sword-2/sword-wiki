<h3>some history</h3>

<p>In 1855 the revised version (RV) was published. It was not popular in the US because it was Brittish. Later the American Standard Version (ASV) came from the revised version. The revised version was not a lot easier to read than the KJV.</p>

<p>The RSV was publised in 1946 (New Testament) and 1952 (whole Bible). It was a revision of the ASV using more modern English. The biggest improvement was the readability of the translation. The RSV removed most archaic pronouns, except those referring to God for example. But that is a minor issue. The biggest problem with the RSV was the theology.</p>

<h3>Some improvements to readability</h3>
<p>Jeremiah 17:4 is more readable in the RSV than the ASV:</p>
<ul>
<li>And thou, even of thyself, shalt discontinue from thy heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn for ever. (Jeremiah 17:4 ASV)</li>
<li>You shall loosen your hand from your heritage which I gave to you, and I will make you serve your ememies in a land which you do not know, for in my anger a fire is kindled which hall burn for ever. (Jeremiah 17:4 RSV)</li>
</ul>


<p>Philippians 1:23 is more readable in the RSV than the ASV because "strait betwixt" was changed to "hard pressed".</p>
<ul>
<li>But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better: (Philippians 1:23 ASV)</li>
<li>I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. (Philippians 1:23 RSV)</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, the translators of the RSV didn't totally remove archaic language - thou, thee, thy. They kept pronouns when referring to God. The word terrible which used to mean awesome is still in Psalm 76.</p>
<ul>
<li>'O Lord GOD, thou hast only begun to show thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as thine? (Deuteronomy 3:24 RSV)</li>
<li>But thou, terrible art thou! Who can stand before thee when once thy anger is roused? (Psalm 76:7 RSV)</li>
</ul>
<h3>archaic pronouns remain</h3>

<p>Why did the translators decide to use the archaic pronouns? They probably thought they had some reverence - a hold over effect. But the original Greek doesn't require archaic pronouns.</p>

<ul>
<li>I have manifested thy name to the men who thou gavest me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gavest them to me, and they have kept thy word." (John 17:6 RSV)</li>
</ul>

<p>The RSV still has misleading words like terrible in Ps 76:7. [terrible used to mean awesome.]</p>
<ul>
<li>But thou, terrible art thou! Who can stand before thee when once thy anger is roused? (Psalm 76:7 RSV)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Theological problems</h3>
<p>There are theological problems as the translators didn't believe in inerrancy of scripture.</p>


<p>The RSV added words which is OK to clarify, but another change is a problem - propitiation to expiation as shown below for 1 John 2:2. The defitions are not the same. The translators (liberal scholars) did not like the idea of God's wrath or that God can be angry at sinners. Many (Conservative bible believing Christians) critizized and rejected the RSV because it gave a low view of scripture and of Christ's atonement, subtracting doctrine. The word propitiation was in about 6 places in the ASV, and all those were changed in the RSV.</p> 
<ul>
<li>and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. (1 John 2:2 ASV)</li>
<li>and he is the expiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. (1 John 2:2 RSV).</li>
 Liberal bible scholars do not like . the RSV didn not only weaken Christ, but also the atonement.  rejected this translation.
</ul>



Genesis 9 conflicts with chapters 3 and 4 about who was the first to till the soil. Saying "began" is different than "first":
<ul>
<li>And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard: (Genesis 9:20 ASV).</li>
<li>Noah was the first tiller of the soil. He planted a vineyard; (Genesis 9:20 RSV).</li>
<li>therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. (Gen 3:23 RSV)</li>
<li>And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground. (Genesis 4:2 RSV)</li>
</ul>


In Matthew they used "young woman" instead of "virgin" which prevents cross-reference to old testament prophecy. 
<ul>
<li>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. (Isaiah 7:14 ASV).</li>
<li>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, a young woman shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Imman'u-el" (Isaiah 7:14 RSV).</li>
<li>"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emman'u-el" (Matthew 1:23 RSV)</li>
</ul>


<p>Not teaching the deity of Christ, minimizes or subtracts doctrine.</p>
<ul>
<li>whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. (Romans 9:5 ASV)</li>
<li>The ancestors are theirs, and from them, by physical descent, came the Christ, who is God over all, praised forever. Amen (Romans 9:5 CSB)</li>
<li>to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ. God who is over all blessed for ever. Amen. (Romans 9:5 RSV).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>This is the tip of the iceberg, there are more problems with the RSV. So conservative Bible-believing Christians rejected the RSV and criticized it strongly. And as a result [- an update to the ASV occurred -] the New American Standard Bible was published in 1963 (New Testament) and 1971 (whole Bible). Then a minor revision was done in 1977 [, etc]. Thankfully this translation avoided the problems in the previous translations.</p>

<p>There were about 40 excellent scholars [for the NASB]. Brad had one in seminary - Robert Thomas for just one class. He was in his 70's / 80's. Brad had him as advisor and he was a great treat. He was a humble man. They are all passed now. One of Brad's favorite books is Robert Thomas's 2 volume book on Revelation.</p>


<p>Consider at how the NASB handles some of the previous problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Then Noah began farming and planted a vineyard. (Genesis 9:20 NASB)</li>
<li>Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and she will name Him Immanuel. (Isaiah 7:14 NASB) Some words are capatilized like Himself and Him. The NASB capatilized pronouns that refer to God, not what happened in the RSV. The KJV capatilized too, but ASV didn't. This is not so common, many translations don't capatilize. There is no basis in the Hebrew or Greek for capatilizing the pronouns. A new reader might not understand the capatilizing. What if you're not sure if a pronoun in referring to God or not? What if a pronoun referes to Jesus but was spoken by one who didn't believe (Matt 12:38). This is one of the minor deficiencies in the NASB.</il>
</ul>

<p>The NASB had italics in 1 John 2:2. People think italics is for emphasis, but the NASB intended it to show something that was added. A better way to identify additions in English might be brackets instead of italics. The NASB is sound in theology, but there are minor weaknesses like italics.</p>

<p>The NASB didn't fade away like the ASV. The publisher decided to do something [with the feedback].</p>
