<title>bible Translations part 1, 2023-06Jun-04</title>
</head><body>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="border1">
Well I'm excited to be able to teach on the subject of bible translations. This is something that I've been wanting to do for quite a few years - I would say at least 4 or 5 years. This has been a topic I've wanted to teach on, and just seems like there's never been a really good opportunity to do it, but finally there's a good opportunity here. We've reached the beginning of the summer - I have more free time now to be able to spend more time researching on this, and making sure I can teach well on this. And so I think its finally the right time to do it. And also in the world of bible translations, it's just been so busy for the last few years, it seems almost every year there is a new bible translation or a revision of a bible translation, that comes out, and every time that happens I think to myself. Well, now I can't do the class 'cause I need to research this, and try to see what has changed, or what's new here. But for the past year or 2 there really hasn't been anything new coming out, so it seems like things have finally settled down, the dust has finally settled in the world of English bible translations. And boy now when you take a to look around at all the different choices, it's pretty dizzying. It just seems like every turn there's another bible translation. And its so difficult to keep track of them all. Its certainly a blessing to have so many English bible translations, but its also a little bit of a curse, because now you're stuck trying to figure out which one to use, or if you wanna use a couple of them, which ones should I use? 'Cause there are so many of them and it would not be practical to try to use every bible translation out there. There are dozens and dozens of them, so we really have to pick one or a few of them to focus our attention on. And this is a huge decision that we face, which bible translation are we going to use regularly? Which other bible translations will we consult occasionally?

</p>

<p class="border1">
God has chosen to reveal himself through his word and so we need to make sure there we're using a good solid bible translation. We should not just pick one at random - go to a bookstore and - Oh here are the choices, or just grab one - Oh this one looks nicest here, it's got a pretty cover on it, that sort of thing. We should not be choosing our bible translations that way. We need to learn about the different strengths and weaknesses of the bible translations and then just try to pick the best one that we can. And so my goal in this class over the next 6 to 12 weeks or so, is to help you get to learn about some of the different English bible translation that are available to us today. We won't be able to cover every single one, some of them are quite obscure, and you won't even find them in a bookstore, but there are plenty of choices out there. So I want to start by giving you a list of some of the most popular bible translations, and these are in alphabetical order, so I'm not trying to give you my preferred order or anything like that. You'll have to stick around to the end of the class to get my recommendations. But here is a list of some of the most popular English bible translation here.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '1:36', '02:40')">audio</a>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Christian Standard Bible (CSB)</li>
<li>English Standard Version (ESV)</li>
<li>King James Version (KJV)</li>
<li>Legacy Standard Bible (LSB)</li>
<li>New American Standard Bible (NASB)</li>
<li>New English Translation (NET)</li>
<li>New International Version (NIV)</li>
<li>New King James Version (NKJV)</li>
<li>New Living Translation (NLT)</li>
</ul>


<p class="border1">
We have the Christian Standard Bible, the CSB is its abbreviated. We have the English Standard Version, or the ESV. I will be using these abbreviations consistently just to save on my breath a little bit. We have the Legacy Standard Bible - that's a newer one - the LSB. The New American Standard Bible that's been around for awhile - NASB. This one is called New English Translation, but most people just call it the 'net' bible, but the technical/longer way of referring to it is New English Translation. We have the New International Version which is a very popular translation, the NIV, its been around for awhile. We have the New King James version which is obviously related to the king James version - the newer version of that, the NKJV. And then the last one I put there is the New Living Translation which is really become quite popular. I think it's now the second best selling bible after the NIV. So it's very popular, so we'll definitely be talking about that and these other ones here.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '02:40', '03:35')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
How many of you are familiar with at least 5 of these 9 translations? At least 5 of these - Oh ya, I've heard of that one before? Okay, how many 7 or more? How many are familiar with all 9 of these translations - you've heard of all 9 of these before? Yeah, if you've been in my class, the everyword Sunday school class, you might remember that I put all these on the screen, well except for 1, the legacy standard bible 'cause that's not in my bible software - its pretty new. But I do consult it and I refer to it - so you've heard me talk about it even though I can't put it on the screen for you. If you haven't been in my class is very likely that some of these are gonna be unfamiliar to you and these are all worth knowing about. And so well be covering all 9 of these translations as we go through this class. And I'll actually be throwing in a few others as well. I could have listed more, but I kind of ran out space on the screen there, so I just picked these 9 that I refer to regularly.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '03:35', '04:28')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
But I will throw in a few others as well that maybe aren't as well known as these. But some of these are kind of connected together, they're related to each other, so I'll add a few more to this list. So we'll probably be covering somewhere between 12 and 15 translations. We'll kind of talk about each one a little bit and give you some example passages, and talk about strengths weaknesses - the history behind them, how they got started, when, those sorts of details. Just to help you get a better handle on them. Now at our church, as I'm sure you are aware, we normally use the Christian Standard Bible, the first one there, in our services, so that abbreviation CSB is usually up on screen whenever we're putting scripture passages up there. But that is not the only translation we use in the services, but it is what we normally use. How many of you use the CSB as your main translation - that's the one that you would normally carry around, and you use? A couple of you would use that as your main translation. How many of you and use a different translation as your main translation - you prefer to use another one? Okay, and out of you, is your translation up on screen there or would it be some other one that I haven't put up there - cause if you use a different one - maybe I should look into it and talk about it - to give you some wisdom on it.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '04:28', '05:39')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Yeah, most of you are probably using something else on the screen, right? What are you guys using? [Class answers: LSB, KJV, NASB, NKJV]. Anybody use another one? Anybody use the ESV? What do you use? [Peter uses the NASB]. Okay, anybody use the NLT, probably not, that one's not very popular in our church. yeah, yeah - maybe you have some of these on your shelf at home, but you just don't use them regularly. NKJV, yeah. Yeah, most Christians do have several different translations. But you sort of have to go with one as your main translation. You can switch from translation to translation as you read through the bible - read though it once in one translation, switch, and try another one another time. Yeah there's a lot of translations here - the CSB is the translation I usually use in my teaching just because that's what we use in the services as well. But I've actually used many of these translations as my main bible in the past. I grew up using the KJV just simply because there were many choices available back in those days. Back in the 80s when I was growing up, most of these translations didn't exist back in those days. We've got a lot of newer translations since I was a kid, so the King James was my first bible, I memorized from it, I memorized a lot of verses from it, I went through the AWANA program and memorized king James version strictly. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '05:39', '07:17')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Then when I was in high school in the 90s, my parents bought me this bible right here - this is the box that I got with it, and the bible. A leather bible right inside here - the spine is kind of worn now, you can't really read a lot of the words on there anymore. This is a MacArthur study bible. And I think this is a 1st edition MacArthur study bible. It was released in 1997, so I got it I think hot off the press, and I've had this ever since. So I used this bible for a couple of years - this is NKJV. This was the only translation the MacArthur study bible was available in when it was first released. That was the 2nd translation I used, the NKJV. But then I went off to college and I got more familiar with another translation, the NASB. I started using this a lot more in college. First, I got this little pocket bible that I would just carry around with me - I could slip it in my pocket and always have it with me. Very small print, but you know, when you're in college you can read anything.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '07:17', '08:16')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So I still have this thing and its still in good shape. And then I also picked up a study bible, this is called the NASB study bible, and so I used this for a couple of years frequently and enjoyed using this. So I use the NASB for while as my main bible, and then, during college, a little bit later in college, so I think this would be probably be the year 2000, one of my friends started using the NLT. And so I picked up a copy - here it is right here - here is the one I bought in 2000 or so and started reading through it. I didn't ever use it as my main bible, but I did carry around from time to time and refer to it and make use of it. So that's the last one there on the screen. Then the next year, in 2001, this bible was released - this is the ESV and I heard about this one before it was released. And as soon as it was released I went to the local bookstore down the street from the college I attended and picked this up. This is the very first ESV bible that was released, it was just a simple reference bible for the ESV. So this was hot off the press and 2001, when the translation was first released. I don't recall ever using this is my main bible, but I definitely made heavy use of it. Its definitely worn here on the side and had it available and made use of it.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '08:16', '09:33')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Then in 2003, I moved out here to California to attend the master's seminary, about 6 months or so after I graduated from college. And the master's seminary is just down below as most of you probably know - its on the campus of Grace community church. And they have a bookstore down there and as I was in the book store one day I saw this [thump sound]. This is a little pocket new testament in a translation called the Holman Christian Standard bible. And I'd never heard of this translation before. So I started paging through it and looking at it and thought - wow, this looks really good. So I bought this little thing and started reading it and then later that year, later in 2003, the whole bible was finished. So the new testament was finished in 1999, I never heard of it until 2003, and a short time later they finished the whole bible, and this was the very first full bible - the Holman Christian Standard Bible that was released and it was not very sturdy. Mine fell apart pretty quickly so I had to upgrade to a different one. I've hung on to this - couldn't part with it even though it's not very usable anymore. But this was the very first full bible in the Holman CSB that I got in 2003 and I really enjoyed this translation. I loved how readable it was and it compared very favorably to other translations I liked - very similar to them but just more readable, and seemed very accurate, and so I've been using this translation for a while. This is now called the Christian Standard Bible - they just dropped the word Holman off of it, and I think 2017. But, yes, it's very similar, they've made some revisions along the way.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '09:33', '11:07')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Then I came to the church here in 2005 and the translation we were using at our church here in the services for the sermons was the NIV. And so I don't remember if I bought this at this time or if I already it - I think I probably had it just because the NIV was a well-known translation, a good one to have available. But then I started using this bible a lot more, I started doing my teaching in the NIV since that's what our senior pastor was using. And so I used this is my main bible for teaching at least, and consulted it frequently otherwise for quite a few years. Then in 2011 this bible was tossed to the side and they came up with the revised version of it still called the NIV. And at that time there were so many changes made to it that were controversial that our elders decided - you know what, we're not gonna make the switch to this new revised NIV. We're going to jump ship on that and stop using the NIV. And one of the reasons they made that decision was I put together kind of a hand out together for them and did a little presentation for them where I talked about the weaknesses of the new NIV and then kind of showed them some alternatives - here are some other choices that are available and some of their strengths and weaknesses. And so they found that to be hopeful thankfully, and that was part of what help them to jump ship on the NIV. We do not use the NIV when we do our teaching anymore. It's okay to use it for comparison because it's not a terrible translation, but there are some problems with it that we'll talk about. And so our elders said - you know what, we don't want to use this as our main teaching translation at the church anymore. And so you won't usually see the NIV mentioned up on screen in the services. And our senior pastor decided to go ahead and switch to use the Holman CSB, the one I really liked, that I recommended.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '11:07', '12:52')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And then we switched of course to the CSB when they did that little name change. So that's a little bit about sort of my history with bible translation - when we switched to the Holmam CSB here I just switched right along with it - I was happy to do that cause I really liked the Homlan CSB, and so I continue to use the CSB today as I teach here at the church. And in 2013, shortly after we made that switch to the Holman CSB, I decided to start a new Sunday school class here at the church where we would basically read through the Holman CSB in about 2 or 2.5 years, 'cause it was a translation that was newer, that most people didn't know about - so I thought - hey, come to this class and let's read through this translation together and just get all the way through the bible. And so that was basically our bible survey class at that time. And it's the class that now exist today, we've never stop meeting since then, we've finished going through the bible, and then we reset and start it over with Genesis, and some of you were already part of the class at that point, or some of you joined at that point. But over time we just kept slowing down, going slower and slower, we were doing a couple chapters a week, 1 chapter a week, and then 10 verses a week, and finally we got down to about 3 or 4 verses a week. And I realized - you know what, there's no way we're ever gonna finish going through the bible in my lifetime. We kind of jumped ship in the middle of Judges and said - its time to go back to the new testament, we haven't been in the new testament for a while, so we jumped over to 1 Corinthians and we've been in 1 Corinthians now for the past couple of years, and been enjoying first Corinthians. And I think everybody who's been part of the class for the last year or two, has been with us since we started 1 Corinthians, for the last couple of years.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '12:52', '14:33')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So I still believe of course in the importance of reading through the whole bible. And so I still like teaching a survey of the bible - but I've just switched it from Sundays to Wednesday's. So now on Wednesday nights at 6 o'clock we're doing bible survey courses as part of the bible institute here at the church. And so for the past year we've been studying through the old testament. We've covered about half the old testament and in the fall we're going to jump back in - taking a break right now. But we're going to be studying Job, Psalms, and Proverbs in the fall, as we do another old testament survey course. And that's something anybody in here can jump into the fall. So if you'd like to take a journey through the old testament, you can jump in and join us. Psalms and Proverbs are 2 of the most fascinating books in the old testament. We'll be getting to know those are pretty well. And so I've been using the Holman CSB and the CSB for a long time but now these are not the only good translations of the bible. There are others as well. Many of these are good solid translations. I look at all of these translations whenever I study a passage in detail, just to kind of see the handling of that passage. Its not something that I would expect anybody else to do. Maybe look at a couple, that would be a good thing. But I like to just look at a whole bunch of different translations, so I like to look at all these. And I find that to be helpful.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '14:33', '15:49')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And so when we're done with this class, however long it takes us, I'm not gonna be telling you there's only one good translation on the bible. I'm not going to pick  one here and say this is the one you all need to be reading, get rid of all the other ones. There are some people out there who reached that conclusion who've said there's only one translation that you should use and the other ones are bad, don't use any of those other ones. I do not agree with that perspective, I think there are many good translations, but there is no perfect translation.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '15:49', '16:16')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
All of these have different strengths and weaknesses. And so one of the goals I have in this class, as we walk through these, cover some of the strengths and weaknesses. And so you can make a well informed decision about which ones you want to spend time in. Now before we start evaluating these translations, we need to talk about the nature of bible translation. Let's just stop and think about what a translation is in general. A translation is simply wording that has been converted from one language to another. Some of you might know a second language, maybe Spanish for example. I do not know any second language fluently, but I learned a little bit of Spanish and so I know enough to say "Buenos dias" to you - its still morning time, that just means good morning. Don't think that I'm fluent in Spanish thought just cause I can say that little phrase to you. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '16:16', '17:06')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So that's a good example right, Buenos dias in Spanish, can be translated, converted into English, as good morning. So when we talk about English translations of the bible, there is an underlying assumption here right? The bible was not originally written in English, it was written in some other language and then converted eventually into English. That's why we refer to these different bibles as bible translations. And so this is the underlying assumption here when we talk about translations - the bible was not originally written in English. Does anyone know the 3 languages the bible was originally written in? [Students: Aramaic, Greek, and Hebrew]. Right, Aramaic, Greek, & Hebrew. Where is the Greek used - which part of the bible? New testament. And then the old testament is where we have Hebrew and Aramaic. Aramaic is only used in as few places, most of the old testament was written in Hebrew, but we do have portions of Ezra and Daniel that are written in Aramaic. But just some very small portions, a couple of chapters in each of those books. Those are the 3 biblical languages, so your bible translation has been converted from those 3 languages - Hebrew & Aramaic in the old testament, Greek in the new testament. So unless you learn these 3 languages, you will need to read the bible in a translation whether it's English or some other language that you know. Now in seminary I learned 2 of those languages there - can you guess which ones? [Student: Greek & Hebrew]. Not Aramaic right, that only covers a small portion the bible. So yeah, I learned Greek and Hebrew. Every seminary student at the master's seminary learns Greek and Hebrew,  we don't become proficient in it, we can't speak in it, but we can dabble in it, we can read it a little bit, dig into it and study in it. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '17:06', '18:54')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
When I finished taking Greek and Hebrew, I enjoyed it. Most students don't really enjoy learning Greek and Hebrew - those are some of the hardest classes in seminary. But I really enjoyed learning Greek and so I decide to get another seminary degree and be able to focus more on the new testament, on studying more Greek. I was a little bit scared of the idea of doing more research in Hebrew 'cause that's a very hard language to learn - it's quite different than what we're familiar with in English. Greek is much more similar, it's a European language like English is. And so I decided to focus more on Greek. I can still get into the Hebrew and study that a little bit, but not as well as I can with Greek. It takes me a little bit longer and I'm not quite as confident when I'm studying in Hebrew. And I do think by the way that every Christian should consider learning biblical Greek because it's really not that hard to learn.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '18:54', '19:41')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
It's pretty similar to English and it's very valuable to be able to study the new testament in more detail. This is where we have most of our christian doctrines taught to us. Sometimes they're taught in the old testament as well, but a lot of times we get the clearest statements of doctrine in the new testament. Its great to be able to get underneath the English and get down to the original Greek. And so if you haven't learned Greek in the past and are interested, we do have that opportunity available through our bible institute. And some of you are already taking Greek. I've actually taught Greek twice in the past, this is the 3rd time I'm teaching Greek now through the institute. We're doing it on Monday nights at 6. And I do plan on offering it every 3 years, so in 2 years we'll offer it again in the fall so if anybody in here wants to join us at that time, [we'd] love to have you learn some Greek. It's not easy, but we go slowly and we take our time so we don't overburden you. When I had Greek classes in seminary, they would often take 20 hours a week to prepare for those. I try to limit that to about 3 hours a week to make little bit more manageable, so we just have to take our time and go through it slowly. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '19:41', '20:43')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
But I do think that it's a fantastic experience to be able to learn Greek, have a Greek new testament, and to look at it and follow along as somebody is reading the bible or preaching from the bible. I still remember taking my Greek new testament to church with me for the first time and being able to follow along a little bit as the preacher's up there preaching from the book of Philippians. And it was just a great experience to be able to see the original words that were written in scripture. So there's just nothing quite like being able to study the bible the original languages, in my opinion. As a Christian, that's one of the best spiritual experiences I think you can have. Unfortunately, most Christians don't have the opportunity to learn Greek, or Hebrew, or Aramaic, I haven't even learned Aramaic. I don't think I'll have the chance to do that. If I'd done advanced study in the old testament, I would have learned Aramaic, but I was too afraid to do that one. So that would have been hard - I had a lot of respect for those old testament guys who kept going and learning more Hebrew and learning Aramaic.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '20:43', '21:36')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
But we are blessed, its a good 2nd prize to have so many good English bible translations. Even if you don't know Greek, or Hebrew, or Aramaic, we have great resources in English, these English bible translations. But we do need to be able to evaluate these translations, and we can't do that very well until we talk about 2 different approaches to translation. And these approaches are called formal equivalence and dynamic equivalence. A formal equivalence basically just gives a literal translation or a word-for-word translation, just going one word at a time and converting each word into English. A dynamic equivalence is focused on giving a more idiomatic translation, so just conveying the meaning of the original Greek or Hebrew or Aramaic into the same meaning in English. So its more like a thought-for-thought translation. Let me give you an example of a word for word translation in the bible. Amos 4:6 has this phrase cleanness of teeth in quite a few bible translations - the <s>ESV,</s> KJV, LSB, NASB, NKJV. They all have that phrase cleanness of teeth. There are a few other translations though that give us a more idiomatic translation. So the CSB has this phrase absolutely nothing to eat. Then a few other translations have similar statements. The NET bible - no food to eat. The NIV - empty stomachs. They're all basically saying the same thing, those 3 translations there.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '21:36', '23:05')">audio</a>
</p>

<table border=1><caption>Amos 4:6</caption>
<tr><th>Translation</th><th>Text</th></tr>
<tr><td>ESV</td><td>"I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places, yet you did not return to me", declares the LORD.</td></tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
They're giving us more of a thought-for-thought translation. And they're doing that because they don't want to mislead readers about the author's intention here. When we read that phrase cleanness of teeth, it might mislead people to think that the author is talking about dental hygiene. But no, he's talking about a shortage of food here. The entire verse says this [verse read]. That verse there is written in Hebrew poetry, the most common feature of Hebrew poetry is parallelism. A lot of poetry in Hebrew has 2 lines of poetry and they match each other, they are parallel to each other. This is what bible scholars call synonymous parallelism, and that's what we have here in this verse. We have 2 lines that are saying basically the same thing. We have this phrase cleanness of teeth, and then in the next statement, we have that phrase lack of bread. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '23:05', '24:04')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And that helps us to understand what Amos meant by that idea of cleanness of teeth. It doesn't mean that you just brush your teeth or that you got teeth whitening and that stuff. No, it just means you have not eaten any food for a while. This is why some bible translation use a more idiomatic translation here, because they want to make sure that you get the meaning that was intended by Amos here. So which of these approaches is correct - should we be using formal equivalence or should we be using dynamic equivalence? You want to know the answer? yes, the answer is yes. Neither of these approaches is wrong. Both of them are legitimate. Their both appropriate to use, and in fact all bible translations use both of these approaches to a certain degree. I do not know what single bible translation that only uses one of these approaches and never uses the other approach. Even the most literal bible translations sometimes use a thought-for-thought approach. Otherwise they would be giving us statements that just make no sense. There's a really interesting phrase that used dozens of times in the Hebrew old testament, and if we were to translate this phrase literally into English, it would be his nose became hot - his nose became hot. This phrase actually normally refers to God. It's used in Numbers chapter 11:1.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '24:04', '25:27')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
But there is not a single translation I found, certainly not these 9, I checked all 9 of them. Not a single one says his nose became hot. In fact, none of them use the word nose here, instead they all have the word anger. They're all giving us and idiomatic translation at this point. And there is nothing wrong with that, they're helping us to see that the reference to God's nose here becoming hot, is just a vivid way of pointing us to God's anger. Just think about a raging bull, how his nostrils are kind of flaring and getting hot as it prepares to charge. That's kind of the idea here - God is becoming angry. That's the whole point of this statement that his nose became hot.

Now this doesn't mean God actually has a nose as part of his essence. John 4:24 tells us clearly that God is Spirit - that's a statement that Jesus made in that verse. And so that statement just means that God does not have a physical aspect as part of his essential being. Certainly God can take on physical forms and reveal himself in that way from time to time. But ultimately God is a spiritual being, and that's why we cannot see him, that's why he's invisible to us. And yet throughout scripture we see various body parts being assigned to God. These statements are what theologians call anthropomorphisms. An anthropomorphism is a statement in which a human body part is attributed to God in order to communicate one of his attributes more vividly. A really good example of this Psalm 89:13. The Psalmist says to God here [verse read]. So the references to God's arm and hand there aren't meant to be taken literally as though God has a body as part of his being, and he has an arm and a hand. No, they are emphasizing 1 of his attributes - which attribute? It's pretty clear right? Power - his power. We can show our power through our arms and our hands, n the way that we use those body parts, and so that's what they're referring to there in that verse, to Gods power. In Numbers 11:1 the word nose there is clearly a reference to God's anger. Now that's a little bit harder to accept, you we can accept the idea that God is very powerful and we understand that imagery of using God's arm and hand for that, but the nose and a reference to God's anger. What are we to do with that? Isn't God a God of love? Yes he is, but God is also a God of anger as well. Psalm 7:11 says [verse read]. So we just simply can't escape the fact that God is a God of wrath. But of course that is not all that he is. Psalm 145:8 says [verse read]. So God is a God of wrath, God is also a God who is great in faithful love, whose abundant in faithful love. So God is both loving and angry as well.

But I like how that verse also says God is slow to anger. And that's how we can understand these attributes in relation to each other. That God does get angry, but he is slow to be angry. And that's a reflection of his love, its put right alongside his love in Psalm 145:8. Guess what, that phrase slow to anger, if we were to get a literal translation from the original Hebrew there, it means long of nose. There's that same word again, nose. So for God to be slow to anger literally means that he's long of nose. The idea basically is that it takes awhile for God's nose to become hot - the bigger the nose the longer it takes for it to become hot.

So we could say, to put it in another illustration, God has a long fuse. It takes awhile for his fuse to be burned up, and for the explosion to take place. I think the idea that he is slow to anger is a good translation there, its not very literal, but it gives us the right idea. God does get angry, he is a God of wrath, but he has slow to become angry. He does not get angry too quickly.

And so God is patient, but that patients does run out. God does eventually punish sinners for their sin. He is patient, he doesn't do it right away very often, but he usually waits and eventually then does punish sin. God is holy, God cannot tolerate sin, so he must punish sinners. Some people will say - okay, yeah God is angry but that's just an old testament concept. In the new testament we don't have the anger God anymore. Oh really, John 3 tells us a different story. Most of you know John 3:16 right? That talks about God's love - God loved the world, he sent his son. But then just 20 versus later in John 3:36 this is what we read [verse read]. Unrepentant sinners are going to experience God's wrath in hell for all eternity. Wrath is not just an old testament thing that's been done away with. No God is still a God of wrath today as well. And I think the people who say there's no wrath of God in the new testament - they must've somehow lost the last book of the bible. The book of Revelation is full of God's wrath. We see it on full display there. We read about the 2nd coming of Jesus in Revelation 19. Listen to verse 15 - this is a pretty scary picture of Jesus [verse read]. So as we study scripture, we need to make sure that we're not getting this lopsided view of God. That's very unfortunate reality in Christianity. Most people think of God as a God of love, not as a God of anger, but they are both true. We need to live in light of all the different attributes of God, not just the ones that we like, just not the ones that we know we know about, we need to learn about all of them and live in light of them.

And there's great application for knowing about God's wrath. First of all, we need to make sure that we're right with God, cause if we're not saved, if we haven't turned from our sins and put our faith in Jesus, we are going to experience the full wrath of God for all eternity. But if we are saved, if we do know Jesus as Lord and Savior then we need to be warning unbelievers around us to flee from the wrath to come. God's wrath is coming on unbelievers and we're here on earth to be able to tell others about how to escape from that wrath. If they will turn from their sins and put their faith in Jesus for salvation then they can be saved and not have to experience God's wrath.

Let's close in prayer and ask for God's help to do that. Thank you so much heavenly Father for your word, and thank you for what it teaches us. Thank you that as we read the bible we can learn about your attributes no matter what translation we're reading. And we thank you Lord that we can understand that you're both a God of love and a God of wrath along with many other attributes as well. And Lord help us to seek to know you as we read your word. Help us not to come to your word primarily to learn about ourselves, but to learn about you. And then we know that we need to live in light of what we learned about you. So I pray that you'd give us a renewed desire to study your word and come to know you better. In Jesus' name. Amen.
