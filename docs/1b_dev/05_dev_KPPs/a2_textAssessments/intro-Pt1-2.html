<h2>Introduction part 1</h2>

<p class="border1">
Well I'm excited to be able to teach on the subject of bible translations. This is something that I've been wanting to do for quite a few years - I would say at least 4 or 5 years. This has been a topic I've wanted to teach on, and just seems like there's never been a really good opportunity to do it, but finally there's a good opportunity here. We've reached the beginning of the summer - I have more free time now to be able to spend more time researching on this, and making sure I can teach well on this. And so I think its finally the right time to do it. And also in the world of bible translations, it's just been so busy for the last few years, it seems almost every year there is a new bible translation or a revision of a bible translation, that comes out, and every time that happens I think to myself. Well, now I can't do the class 'cause I need to research this, and try to see what has changed, or what's new here. But for the past year or 2 there really hasn't been anything new coming out, so it seems like things have finally settled down, the dust has finally settled in the world of English bible translations. And boy now when you take a to look around at all the different choices, it's pretty dizzying. It just seems like every turn there's another bible translation. And its so difficult to keep track of them all. Its certainly a blessing to have so many English bible translations, but its also a little bit of a curse, because now you're stuck trying to figure out which one to use, or if you wanna use a couple of them, which ones should I use? 'Cause there are so many of them and it would not be practical to try to use every bible translation out there. There are dozens and dozens of them, so we really have to pick one or a few of them to focus our attention on. And this is a huge decision that we face, which bible translation are we going to use regularly? Which other bible translations will we consult occasionally?

</p>

<p class="border1">
God has chosen to reveal himself through his word and so we need to make sure there we're using a good solid bible translation. We should not just pick one at random - go to a bookstore and - Oh here are the choices, or just grab one - Oh this one looks nicest here, it's got a pretty cover on it, that sort of thing. We should not be choosing our bible translations that way. We need to learn about the different strengths and weaknesses of the bible translations and then just try to pick the best one that we can. And so my goal in this class over the next 6 to 12 weeks or so, is to help you get to learn about some of the different English bible translation that are available to us today. We won't be able to cover every single one, some of them are quite obscure, and you won't even find them in a bookstore, but there are plenty of choices out there. So I want to start by giving you a list of some of the most popular bible translations, and these are in alphabetical order, so I'm not trying to give you my preferred order or anything like that. You'll have to stick around to the end of the class to get my recommendations. But here is a list of some of the most popular English bible translation here.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '1:36', '02:40')">audio</a>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Christian Standard Bible (CSB)</li>
<li>English Standard Version (ESV)</li>
<li>King James Version (KJV)</li>
<li>Legacy Standard Bible (LSB)</li>
<li>New American Standard Bible (NASB)</li>
<li>New English Translation (NET)</li>
<li>New International Version (NIV)</li>
<li>New King James Version (NKJV)</li>
<li>New Living Translation (NLT)</li>
</ul>


<p class="border1">
We have the Christian Standard Bible, the CSB is its abbreviated. We have the English Standard Version, or the ESV. I will be using these abbreviations consistently just to save on my breath a little bit. We have the Legacy Standard Bible - that's a newer one - the LSB. The New American Standard Bible that's been around for awhile - NASB. This one is called New English Translation, but most people just call it the 'net' bible, but the technical/longer way of referring to it is New English Translation. We have the New International Version which is a very popular translation, the NIV, its been around for awhile. We have the New King James version which is obviously related to the king James version - the newer version of that, the NKJV. And then the last one I put there is the New Living Translation which is really become quite popular. I think it's now the second best selling bible after the NIV. So it's very popular, so we'll definitely be talking about that and these other ones here.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '02:40', '03:35')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
How many of you are familiar with at least 5 of these 9 translations? At least 5 of these - Oh ya, I've heard of that one before? Okay, how many 7 or more? How many are familiar with all 9 of these translations - you've heard of all 9 of these before? Yeah, if you've been in my class, the everyword Sunday school class, you might remember that I put all these on the screen, well except for 1, the legacy standard bible 'cause that's not in my bible software - its pretty new. But I do consult it and I refer to it - so you've heard me talk about it even though I can't put it on the screen for you. If you haven't been in my class is very likely that some of these are gonna be unfamiliar to you and these are all worth knowing about. And so well be covering all 9 of these translations as we go through this class. And I'll actually be throwing in a few others as well. I could have listed more, but I kind of ran out space on the screen there, so I just picked these 9 that I refer to regularly.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '03:35', '04:28')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
But I will throw in a few others as well that maybe aren't as well known as these. But some of these are kind of connected together, they're related to each other, so I'll add a few more to this list. So we'll probably be covering somewhere between 12 and 15 translations. We'll kind of talk about each one a little bit and give you some example passages, and talk about strengths weaknesses - the history behind them, how they got started, when, those sorts of details. Just to help you get a better handle on them. Now at our church, as I'm sure you are aware, we normally use the Christian Standard Bible, the first one there, in our services, so that abbreviation CSB is usually up on screen whenever we're putting scripture passages up there. But that is not the only translation we use in the services, but it is what we normally use. How many of you use the CSB as your main translation - that's the one that you would normally carry around, and you use? A couple of you would use that as your main translation. How many of you and use a different translation as your main translation - you prefer to use another one? Okay, and out of you, is your translation up on screen there or would it be some other one that I haven't put up there - cause if you use a different one - maybe I should look into it and talk about it - to give you some wisdom on it.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '04:28', '05:39')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Yeah, most of you are probably using something else on the screen, right? What are you guys using? [Class answers: LSB, KJV, NASB, NKJV]. Anybody use another one? Anybody use the ESV? What do you use? [Peter uses the NASB]. Okay, anybody use the NLT, probably not, that one's not very popular in our church. yeah, yeah - maybe you have some of these on your shelf at home, but you just don't use them regularly. NKJV, yeah. Yeah, most Christians do have several different translations. But you sort of have to go with one as your main translation. You can switch from translation to translation as you read through the bible - read though it once in one translation, switch, and try another one another time. Yeah there's a lot of translations here - the CSB is the translation I usually use in my teaching just because that's what we use in the services as well. But I've actually used many of these translations as my main bible in the past. I grew up using the KJV just simply because there were many choices available back in those days. Back in the 80s when I was growing up, most of these translations didn't exist back in those days. We've got a lot of newer translations since I was a kid, so the King James was my first bible, I memorized from it, I memorized a lot of verses from it, I went through the AWANA program and memorized king James version strictly. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '05:39', '07:17')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Then when I was in high school in the 90s, my parents bought me this bible right here - this is the box that I got with it, and the bible. A leather bible right inside here - the spine is kind of worn now, you can't really read a lot of the words on there anymore. This is a MacArthur study bible. And I think this is a 1st edition MacArthur study bible. It was released in 1997, so I got it I think hot off the press, and I've had this ever since. So I used this bible for a couple of years - this is NKJV. This was the only translation the MacArthur study bible was available in when it was first released. That was the 2nd translation I used, the NKJV. But then I went off to college and I got more familiar with another translation, the NASB. I started using this a lot more in college. First, I got this little pocket bible that I would just carry around with me - I could slip it in my pocket and always have it with me. Very small print, but you know, when you're in college you can read anything.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '07:17', '08:16')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So I still have this thing and its still in good shape. And then I also picked up a study bible, this is called the NASB study bible, and so I used this for a couple of years frequently and enjoyed using this. So I use the NASB for while as my main bible, and then, during college, a little bit later in college, so I think this would be probably be the year 2000, one of my friends started using the NLT. And so I picked up a copy - here it is right here - here is the one I bought in 2000 or so and started reading through it. I didn't ever use it as my main bible, but I did carry around from time to time and refer to it and make use of it. So that's the last one there on the screen. Then the next year, in 2001, this bible was released - this is the ESV and I heard about this one before it was released. And as soon as it was released I went to the local bookstore down the street from the college I attended and picked this up. This is the very first ESV bible that was released, it was just a simple reference bible for the ESV. So this was hot off the press and 2001, when the translation was first released. I don't recall ever using this is my main bible, but I definitely made heavy use of it. Its definitely worn here on the side and had it available and made use of it.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '08:16', '09:33')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Then in 2003, I moved out here to California to attend the master's seminary, about 6 months or so after I graduated from college. And the master's seminary is just down below as most of you probably know - its on the campus of Grace community church. And they have a bookstore down there and as I was in the book store one day I saw this [thump sound]. This is a little pocket new testament in a translation called the Holman Christian Standard bible. And I'd never heard of this translation before. So I started paging through it and looking at it and thought - wow, this looks really good. So I bought this little thing and started reading it and then later that year, later in 2003, the whole bible was finished. So the new testament was finished in 1999, I never heard of it until 2003, and a short time later they finished the whole bible, and this was the very first full bible - the Holman Christian Standard Bible that was released and it was not very sturdy. Mine fell apart pretty quickly so I had to upgrade to a different one. I've hung on to this - couldn't part with it even though it's not very usable anymore. But this was the very first full bible in the Holman CSB that I got in 2003 and I really enjoyed this translation. I loved how readable it was and it compared very favorably to other translations I liked - very similar to them but just more readable, and seemed very accurate, and so I've been using this translation for a while. This is now called the Christian Standard Bible - they just dropped the word Holman off of it, and I think 2017. But, yes, it's very similar, they've made some revisions along the way.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '09:33', '11:07')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Then I came to the church here in 2005 and the translation we were using at our church here in the services for the sermons was the NIV. And so I don't remember if I bought this at this time or if I already it - I think I probably had it just because the NIV was a well-known translation, a good one to have available. But then I started using this bible a lot more, I started doing my teaching in the NIV since that's what our senior pastor was using. And so I used this is my main bible for teaching at least, and consulted it frequently otherwise for quite a few years. Then in 2011 this bible was tossed to the side and they came up with the revised version of it still called the NIV. And at that time there were so many changes made to it that were controversial that our elders decided - you know what, we're not gonna make the switch to this new revised NIV. We're going to jump ship on that and stop using the NIV. And one of the reasons they made that decision was I put together kind of a hand out together for them and did a little presentation for them where I talked about the weaknesses of the new NIV and then kind of showed them some alternatives - here are some other choices that are available and some of their strengths and weaknesses. And so they found that to be hopeful thankfully, and that was part of what help them to jump ship on the NIV. We do not use the NIV when we do our teaching anymore. It's okay to use it for comparison because it's not a terrible translation, but there are some problems with it that we'll talk about. And so our elders said - you know what, we don't want to use this as our main teaching translation at the church anymore. And so you won't usually see the NIV mentioned up on screen in the services. And our senior pastor decided to go ahead and switch to use the Holman CSB, the one I really liked, that I recommended.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '11:07', '12:52')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And then we switched of course to the CSB when they did that little name change. So that's a little bit about sort of my history with bible translation - when we switched to the Holmam CSB here I just switched right along with it - I was happy to do that cause I really liked the Homlan CSB, and so I continue to use the CSB today as I teach here at the church. And in 2013, shortly after we made that switch to the Holman CSB, I decided to start a new Sunday school class here at the church where we would basically read through the Holman CSB in about 2 or 2.5 years, 'cause it was a translation that was newer, that most people didn't know about - so I thought - hey, come to this class and let's read through this translation together and just get all the way through the bible. And so that was basically our bible survey class at that time. And it's the class that now exist today, we've never stop meeting since then, we've finished going through the bible, and then we reset and start it over with Genesis, and some of you were already part of the class at that point, or some of you joined at that point. But over time we just kept slowing down, going slower and slower, we were doing a couple chapters a week, 1 chapter a week, and then 10 verses a week, and finally we got down to about 3 or 4 verses a week. And I realized - you know what, there's no way we're ever gonna finish going through the bible in my lifetime. We kind of jumped ship in the middle of Judges and said - its time to go back to the new testament, we haven't been in the new testament for a while, so we jumped over to 1 Corinthians and we've been in 1 Corinthians now for the past couple of years, and been enjoying first Corinthians. And I think everybody who's been part of the class for the last year or two, has been with us since we started 1 Corinthians, for the last couple of years.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '12:52', '14:33')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So I still believe of course in the importance of reading through the whole bible. And so I still like teaching a survey of the bible - but I've just switched it from Sundays to Wednesday's. So now on Wednesday nights at 6 o'clock we're doing bible survey courses as part of the bible institute here at the church. And so for the past year we've been studying through the old testament. We've covered about half the old testament and in the fall we're going to jump back in - taking a break right now. But we're going to be studying Job, Psalms, and Proverbs in the fall, as we do another old testament survey course. And that's something anybody in here can jump into the fall. So if you'd like to take a journey through the old testament, you can jump in and join us. Psalms and Proverbs are 2 of the most fascinating books in the old testament. We'll be getting to know those are pretty well. And so I've been using the Holman CSB and the CSB for a long time but now these are not the only good translations of the bible. There are others as well. Many of these are good solid translations. I look at all of these translations whenever I study a passage in detail, just to kind of see the handling of that passage. Its not something that I would expect anybody else to do. Maybe look at a couple, that would be a good thing. But I like to just look at a whole bunch of different translations, so I like to look at all these. And I find that to be helpful.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '14:33', '15:49')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And so when we're done with this class, however long it takes us, I'm not gonna be telling you there's only one good translation on the bible. I'm not going to pick  one here and say this is the one you all need to be reading, get rid of all the other ones. There are some people out there who reached that conclusion who've said there's only one translation that you should use and the other ones are bad, don't use any of those other ones. I do not agree with that perspective, I think there are many good translations, but there is no perfect translation.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '15:49', '16:16')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
All of these have different strengths and weaknesses. And so one of the goals I have in this class, as we walk through these, cover some of the strengths and weaknesses. And so you can make a well informed decision about which ones you want to spend time in. Now before we start evaluating these translations, we need to talk about the nature of bible translation. Let's just stop and think about what a translation is in general. A translation is simply wording that has been converted from one language to another. Some of you might know a second language, maybe Spanish for example. I do not know any second language fluently, but I learned a little bit of Spanish and so I know enough to say "Buenos dias" to you - its still morning time, that just means good morning. Don't think that I'm fluent in Spanish thought just cause I can say that little phrase to you. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '16:16', '17:06')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So that's a good example right, Buenos dias in Spanish, can be translated, converted into English, as good morning. So when we talk about English translations of the bible, there is an underlying assumption here right? The bible was not originally written in English, it was written in some other language and then converted eventually into English. That's why we refer to these different bibles as bible translations. And so this is the underlying assumption here when we talk about translations - the bible was not originally written in English. Does anyone know the 3 languages the bible was originally written in? [Students: Aramaic, Greek, and Hebrew]. Right, Aramaic, Greek, & Hebrew. Where is the Greek used - which part of the bible? New testament. And then the old testament is where we have Hebrew and Aramaic. Aramaic is only used in as few places, most of the old testament was written in Hebrew, but we do have portions of Ezra and Daniel that are written in Aramaic. But just some very small portions, a couple of chapters in each of those books. Those are the 3 biblical languages, so your bible translation has been converted from those 3 languages - Hebrew & Aramaic in the old testament, Greek in the new testament. So unless you learn these 3 languages, you will need to read the bible in a translation whether it's English or some other language that you know. Now in seminary I learned 2 of those languages there - can you guess which ones? [Student: Greek & Hebrew]. Not Aramaic right, that only covers a small portion the bible. So yeah, I learned Greek and Hebrew. Every seminary student at the master's seminary learns Greek and Hebrew,  we don't become proficient in it, we can't speak in it, but we can dabble in it, we can read it a little bit, dig into it and study in it. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '17:06', '18:54')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
When I finished taking Greek and Hebrew, I enjoyed it. Most students don't really enjoy learning Greek and Hebrew - those are some of the hardest classes in seminary. But I really enjoyed learning Greek and so I decide to get another seminary degree and be able to focus more on the new testament, on studying more Greek. I was a little bit scared of the idea of doing more research in Hebrew 'cause that's a very hard language to learn - it's quite different than what we're familiar with in English. Greek is much more similar, it's a European language like English is. And so I decided to focus more on Greek. I can still get into the Hebrew and study that a little bit, but not as well as I can with Greek. It takes me a little bit longer and I'm not quite as confident when I'm studying in Hebrew. And I do think by the way that every Christian should consider learning biblical Greek because it's really not that hard to learn.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '18:54', '19:41')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
It's pretty similar to English and it's very valuable to be able to study the new testament in more detail. This is where we have most of our christian doctrines taught to us. Sometimes they're taught in the old testament as well, but a lot of times we get the clearest statements of doctrine in the new testament. Its great to be able to get underneath the English and get down to the original Greek. And so if you haven't learned Greek in the past and are interested, we do have that opportunity available through our bible institute. And some of you are already taking Greek. I've actually taught Greek twice in the past, this is the 3rd time I'm teaching Greek now through the institute. We're doing it on Monday nights at 6. And I do plan on offering it every 3 years, so in 2 years we'll offer it again in the fall so if anybody in here wants to join us at that time, [we'd] love to have you learn some Greek. It's not easy, but we go slowly and we take our time so we don't overburden you. When I had Greek classes in seminary, they would often take 20 hours a week to prepare for those. I try to limit that to about 3 hours a week to make little bit more manageable, so we just have to take our time and go through it slowly. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '19:41', '20:43')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
But I do think that it's a fantastic experience to be able to learn Greek, have a Greek new testament, and to look at it and follow along as somebody is reading the bible or preaching from the bible. I still remember taking my Greek new testament to church with me for the first time and being able to follow along a little bit as the preacher's up there preaching from the book of Philippians. And it was just a great experience to be able to see the original words that were written in scripture. So there's just nothing quite like being able to study the bible the original languages, in my opinion. As a Christian, that's one of the best spiritual experiences I think you can have. Unfortunately, most Christians don't have the opportunity to learn Greek, or Hebrew, or Aramaic, I haven't even learned Aramaic. I don't think I'll have the chance to do that. If I'd done advanced study in the old testament, I would have learned Aramaic, but I was too afraid to do that one. So that would have been hard - I had a lot of respect for those old testament guys who kept going and learning more Hebrew and learning Aramaic.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '20:43', '21:36')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
But we are blessed, its a good 2nd prize to have so many good English bible translations. Even if you don't know Greek, or Hebrew, or Aramaic, we have great resources in English, these English bible translations. But we do need to be able to evaluate these translations, and we can't do that very well until we talk about 2 different approaches to translation. And these approaches are called formal equivalence and dynamic equivalence. A formal equivalence basically just gives a literal translation or a word-for-word translation, just going one word at a time and converting each word into English. A dynamic equivalence is focused on giving a more idiomatic translation, so just conveying the meaning of the original Greek or Hebrew or Aramaic into the same meaning in English. So its more like a thought-for-thought translation. Let me give you an example of a word for word translation in the bible. Amos 4:6 has this phrase cleanness of teeth in quite a few bible translations - the <s>ESV,</s> KJV, LSB, NASB, NKJV. They all have that phrase cleanness of teeth. There are a few other translations though that give us a more idiomatic translation. So the CSB has this phrase absolutely nothing to eat. Then a few other translations have similar statements. The NET bible - no food to eat. The NIV - empty stomachs. They're all basically saying the same thing, those 3 translations there.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '21:36', '23:05')">audio</a>
</p>

<table border=1><caption>Amos 4:6</caption>
<tr><th>Translation</th><th>Text</th></tr>
<tr><td>ESV</td><td>"I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places, yet you did not return to me", declares the LORD.</td></tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
They're giving us more of a thought-for-thought translation. And they're doing that because they don't want to mislead readers about the author's intention here. When we read that phrase cleanness of teeth, it might mislead people to think that the author is talking about dental hygiene. But no, he's talking about a shortage of food here. The entire verse says this [verse read]. That verse there is written in Hebrew poetry, the most common feature of Hebrew poetry is parallelism. A lot of poetry in Hebrew has 2 lines of poetry and they match each other, they are parallel to each other. This is what bible scholars call synonymous parallelism, and that's what we have here in this verse. We have 2 lines that are saying basically the same thing. We have this phrase cleanness of teeth, and then in the next statement, we have that phrase lack of bread. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '23:05', '24:04')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And that helps us to understand what Amos meant by that idea of cleanness of teeth. It doesn't mean that you just brush your teeth or that you got teeth whitening and that stuff. No, it just means you have not eaten any food for a while. This is why some bible translation use a more idiomatic translation here, because they want to make sure that you get the meaning that was intended by Amos here. So which of these approaches is correct - should we be using formal equivalence or should we be using dynamic equivalence? You want to know the answer? yes, the answer is yes. Neither of these approaches is wrong. Both of them are legitimate. Their both appropriate to use, and in fact all bible translations use both of these approaches to a certain degree. I do not know what single bible translation that only uses one of these approaches and never uses the other approach. Even the most literal bible translations sometimes use a thought-for-thought approach. Otherwise they would be giving us statements that just make no sense. There's a really interesting phrase that used dozens of times in the Hebrew old testament, and if we were to translate this phrase literally into English, it would be his nose became hot - his nose became hot. This phrase actually normally refers to God. It's used in Numbers chapter 11:1.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '24:04', '25:27')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
But there is not a single translation I found, certainly not these 9, I checked all 9 of them. Not a single one says his nose became hot. In fact, none of them use the word nose here, instead they all have the word anger. They're all giving us and idiomatic translation at this point. And there is nothing wrong with that, they're helping us to see that the reference to God's nose here becoming hot, is just a vivid way of pointing us to God's anger. Just think about a raging bull, how his nostrils are kind of flaring and getting hot as it prepares to charge. That's kind of the idea here - God is becoming angry. That's the whole point of this statement that his nose became hot.

<p class="border1">
Now this doesn't mean God actually has a nose as part of his essence. John 4:24 tells us clearly that God is Spirit - that's a statement that Jesus made in that verse. And so that statement just means that God does not have a physical aspect as part of his essential being. Certainly God can take on physical forms and reveal himself in that way from time to time. But ultimately God is a spiritual being, and that's why we cannot see him, that's why he's invisible to us. And yet throughout scripture we see various body parts being assigned to God. These statements are what theologians call anthropomorphisms. An anthropomorphism is a statement in which a human body part is attributed to God in order to communicate one of his attributes more vividly. A really good example of this Psalm 89:13. The Psalmist says to God here [verse read]. So the references to God's arm and hand there aren't meant to be taken literally as though God has a body as part of his being, and he has an arm and a hand. No, they are emphasizing 1 of his attributes - which attribute? It's pretty clear right? Power - his power. We can show our power through our arms and our hands, n the way that we use those body parts, and so that's what they're referring to there in that verse, to Gods power. In Numbers 11:1 the word nose there is clearly a reference to God's anger. Now that's a little bit harder to accept, you we can accept the idea that God is very powerful and we understand that imagery of using God's arm and hand for that, but the nose and a reference to God's anger. What are we to do with that? Isn't God a God of love? Yes he is, but God is also a God of anger as well. Psalm 7:11 says [verse read]. So we just simply can't escape the fact that God is a God of wrath. But of course that is not all that he is. Psalm 145:8 says [verse read]. So God is a God of wrath, God is also a God who is great in faithful love, whose abundant in faithful love. So God is both loving and angry as well.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '26:09', '28:28')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
But I like how that verse also says God is slow to anger. And that's how we can understand these attributes in relation to each other. That God does get angry, but he is slow to be angry. And that's a reflection of his love, its put right alongside his love in Psalm 145:8. Guess what, that phrase slow to anger, if we were to get a literal translation from the original Hebrew there, it means long of nose. There's that same word again, nose. So for God to be slow to anger literally means that he's long of nose. The idea basically is that it takes awhile for God's nose to become hot - the bigger the nose the longer it takes for it to become hot.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '28:28', '29:07')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So we could say, to put it in another illustration, God has a long fuse. It takes awhile for his fuse to be burned up, and for the explosion to take place. I think the idea that he is slow to anger is a good translation there, its not very literal, but it gives us the right idea. God does get angry, he is a God of wrath, but he has slow to become angry. He does not get angry too quickly.

<p class="border1">
And so God is patient, but that patients does run out. God does eventually punish sinners for their sin. He is patient, he doesn't do it right away very often, but he usually waits and eventually then does punish sin. God is holy, God cannot tolerate sin, so he must punish sinners. Some people will say - okay, yeah God is angry but that's just an old testament concept. In the new testament we don't have the anger God anymore. Oh really, John 3 tells us a different story. Most of you know John 3:16 right? That talks about God's love - God loved the world, he sent his son. But then just 20 versus later in John 3:36 this is what we read [verse read]. Unrepentant sinners are going to experience God's wrath in hell for all eternity. Wrath is not just an old testament thing that's been done away with. No God is still a God of wrath today as well. And I think the people who say there's no wrath of God in the new testament - they must've somehow lost the last book of the bible. The book of Revelation is full of God's wrath. We see it on full display there. We read about the 2nd coming of Jesus in Revelation 19. Listen to verse 15 - this is a pretty scary picture of Jesus [verse read]. So as we study scripture, we need to make sure that we're not getting this lopsided view of God. That's very unfortunate reality in Christianity. Most people think of God as a God of love, not as a God of anger, but they are both true. We need to live in light of all the different attributes of God, not just the ones that we like, just not the ones that we know we know about, we need to learn about all of them and live in light of them.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '29:30', '31:19')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And there's great application for knowing about God's wrath. First of all, we need to make sure that we're right with God, cause if we're not saved, if we haven't turned from our sins and put our faith in Jesus, we are going to experience the full wrath of God for all eternity. But if we are saved, if we do know Jesus as Lord and Savior then we need to be warning unbelievers around us to flee from the wrath to come. God's wrath is coming on unbelievers and we're here on earth to be able to tell others about how to escape from that wrath. If they will turn from their sins and put their faith in Jesus for salvation then they can be saved and not have to experience God's wrath.

<p class="border1">
Let's close in prayer and ask for God's help to do that. Thank you so much heavenly Father for your word, and thank you for what it teaches us. Thank you that as we read the bible we can learn about your attributes no matter what translation we're reading. And we thank you Lord that we can understand that you're both a God of love and a God of wrath along with many other attributes as well. And Lord help us to seek to know you as we read your word. Help us not to come to your word primarily to learn about ourselves, but to learn about you. And then we know that we need to live in light of what we learned about you. So I pray that you'd give us a renewed desire to study your word and come to know you better. In Jesus' name. Amen.

<h2>Introduction part 2</h2>

<p class="border1">
Last week we began our study on bible translations, we started with a brief introduction and we'll have a further introduction today before we dig into the specific bible translations.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '00:00', '00:13')">audio</a>
</p>

<h3 id="review">Review</h3>


<p class="border1">
So let's do a little bit of review before we continue with our introduction. Last week we talked about the fact that a translation is simply wording that has been converted from one language to another. And what this means of course is that the bible was not originally written in English. Does anybody remember what the 3 languages are the bible was originally written in? [students Jeff & Liz} Aramaic, Hebrew, & Greek - very good.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '00:13', '00:41')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So Greek is of course in the new testament, Hebrew and Aramaic in the old testament. Most of the old testament was written Hebrew, but there are a few portions, smaller sections, that were written in Aramaic. So if you know these original languages, if you can kind of muddle your way through, if you even know them a little bit, well then you don't ultimately need a bible translation. Because you can go back to the original Greek and Hebrew and Aramaic and just study the bible as it was originally written. But it is a lot of work to learn these 3 different <s>translations</s> [languages], even pastors when they go to seminary they don't learn all 3 of those usually. They just learn 2 of them, if they go to a good seminary at least, like the one I went to, then you learn Hebrew and you learn Greek, but the only way you're going to learn Aramaic is it you stay longer and do more advanced study in the old testament. And I did not get to do that, I chose to focus on new testament instead of old testament. So I never learned Aramaic, but I did learn Hebrew and Greek, so I still need even to look at bible translations, especially when we're in those Aramaic portions of the old testament. And most Christians of course don't learn any of these languages. I was encouraging you guys to consider learning Greek last week - we do offer Greek classes here that I teach at the church through our bible institute and some of you in here are doing those, and others are welcome to do it next time we offer Greek. You have to start at the beginning for Greek - you can't just jump in the middle, so the next time we start we'll advertise that, and love to have some of you jump in and learn Greek. Its not too hard to learn it if you just stay consistent with it, and just keep working at it, and stick around for the long haul, and eventually you'll learn enough Greek that you can work your way through the new testament with pretty good understanding.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '00:40', '02:17')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
But most Christians don't even have that opportunity - they're not at a church where they can take a Greek class. They wouldn't even know where to begin to search for how they can learn Greek. You know just searching online could turn up lots of results and who knows how reliable some of those places are that would try to teach you Greek. And then trying to teach yourself without being in a class with a teacher who's live - that's very difficult. So most Christians do not learn any of the biblical languages. And so we need a bible translation if we're going to be able to read and study God's word. And there are so many English bible translations to choose from. I put 9 of them up on the screen last week and that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are many others as well. And so it's very difficult to figure out which bible translation should I be using? There's no way you can reasonably use every bible translation that's out there. If you try to study a passage using every bible translation, well you'd be reading different bible translations for quite a while, and then after a while you would just be in a panic. Your head would be spinning around trying to get a handle on all the different translations and all their differences, trying to figure out which ones are accurate, which ones are not. That's just not reasonable, you have to narrow in and choose one or maybe a few bible translations to use. And so we need to evaluate the translations that are out there so that we can make a well informed decision. The best place to start with evaluating bible translations is to realize that there are 2 different approaches to translation. Does anybody remember what these two approaches are called?
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '02:16', '03:50')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
We use the word equivalence and then we put a word in front - a different word for the 2 different approach. What's one type of equivalence? Formal equivalence is one of them, that's a literal or word-for-word translation. What's the other kind of equivalence? Dynamic equivalence, that gives a thought-for-thought translation, or what we might call an idiomatic translation, just taking the idea in the original text and converting that to the same idea in the other language.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '03:50', '04:21')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Last week I showed you an example of these 2 approaches in Amos 4:6. A literal translation there which we can find in some of our bible translations is the phrase cleanness of teeth. Do you remember that phrase cleanness of teeth? Other translations though do not give us that literal translation, instead they give us more of an idiomatic translation. So they would have something like no food to eat. And they do that because they don't want to miss-lead the readers about what Amos intended there. He was not talking about dental hygiene, about somebody who just brushed his teeth. That is not the point. When you read the context there you can see that it has to do with a shortage of food instead. And so some translations, instead of giving you the word-for-word literal translation, they're just converting the meaning of that into a more normal way of speaking about that in English. So I think we can conclude that both of these approaches are legitimate, they're both appropriate to use. In fact, I don't know os a single bible translation in English that uses only one of those approaches and never uses the other approach. Every single bible translation uses both formal equivalence and dynamic equivalence to some degree. Last week I told you about this interesting phrase that's used quite a bit in the Hebrew old testament. And if we translate it literally, it would be translated his nose became hot. But if you were to look throughout your English bible translations you will never see that phrase his nose became hot anywhere in our English bible translations, especially if you know where to look for it, if you know where it is in Hebrew - those 60 or 70 times or so that it is used, and you go look at those verses, you will not find that phrase in any English bible translation that you could go buy at Amazon or Christian book or in some Christian bookstore. You just wouldn't find that phrase. Every bible translation that I looked at, all 9 of the ones that I put on the screen last week, they all refer to God's anger instead of God's nose.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '04:21', '06:21')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
That's because God doesn't actually have a nose, he is a spirit, and so this is an anthropomorphism as I explained last week. This is just a vivid way of stressing one of God's attributes. And the attribute that's being stressed there is clearly in the context - God's anger. So the point here is that no bible translation is literal completely all of the time, even our most literal bible translations use dynamic equivalence occasionally to some degree, they use it from time to time. And so we need to watch out for the danger of oversimplification when we evaluate bible translations. We should not just say that some bible translations are formal equivalence translations and that others are dynamic equivalence translations. That is an oversimplification. A better way to evaluate bible translations is to ask how often they use formal equivalence and how often they use dynamic equivalence. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '06:21', '07:17')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Think of it this way, think of a spectrum, and we can put numbers on that spectrum from 1 to 100. So maybe think of a left to right spectrum, 1 is on the left 100 is on the right. Number 1 would represent a perfect formal equivalence and then 100 could represent perfect dynamic equivalence, or you can reverse that if you choose, it doesn't really matter. Just put one of those on one extreme and one on the other. And what we would have to conclude is that there is no bible translation that would be located at the number 1 or at the number 100. They would all fall somewhere in between those two extremes. Now some of them are going to lean just slightly to one side or the other, and then other translations might lean more strongly towards one of those sides. And so when we actually start focusing on individual translations which I promise you is coming shortly - starting next week we will do that. I'm going to give you my best guess at where they fall on that spectrum, so I will assign a number between 1 and 100 for each bible translation. And I'm pretty sure I'm going to be able to give each translation a different number. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '07:17', '08:23')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
There are no 2 translations that fall exactly at the same place on the spectrum. Now if you used maybe 1 to 10, then you could put some translations at the same number. But we're going to use more numbers, we're going to go from 1 to 100 and that way we can have finer control over where exactly they fall.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '08:23', '08:40')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And I will have a different number for you for each translation. And that allows us to compare them to each other to see which ones are more literal than others, or which ones are more dynamically equivalent. We will have some translations are very close together, but I do want to try to distinguish them because there are no 2 translations are completely identical and that have the exact same balance between dynamic equivalence and formal equivalence. So what this means is there is a lot of diversity among English bible translations today - no 2 translations are exactly the same on this spectrum. The reasons for this diversity is that different bible translations have different purposes. Translations that lean toward dynamic equivalence tend to be easier to read and understand. They are generally more helpful for faster reading and for getting the big idea. So they're well suited for kids, for non-Christians, and for new believers.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '08:40', '09:39')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
On the other hand, translations that lean toward formal equivalence tend to have a stronger connection to the original text. They are generally more helpful for careful bible study. If you wanna try to access the original language, but you don't know the original languages, well the best way to do that is through a translation that leans strongly toward formal equivalence cause its going to have a kind of 1-to-1 correspondence to the original text, quite a bit, not perfectly of course as I already said. But it will be more like that. And these translations are well suited for educated readers and for mature believers - people who are able to read at a high level and who understand Christianity pretty well and are able to dig into the details of scripture.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '09:39', '10:26')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So you can see that different bible translations, they're gonna have different strengths and weaknesses. And some of them will then be useful more often in certain situations than others. A bible translation that leans strongly toward formal equivalence will not usually be a good choice for young children to read. Cause they're gonna have a hard time with the complicated sentences and all the unfamiliar words that are in there, the words that are just only used rarely in the English language.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '10:26', '10:54')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
And so it would be better for young children, you know 5, 6, 7, 8 year old's, we could say, it would be better for them to use a translation that leans more strongly toward dynamic equivalence, because usually those translations are much, much easier to read. They have a limited vocabulary, they only maybe have 1000 English words in there instead of 3000 different words. And so it's easier for younger readers to handle that sort of a translation. But as kids get older, as they move into 4th grade, 5th grade, and 6th grade, well now they are able to handle a translation that is moving more toward the literal direction on that spectrum. I'm not saying they should just jump from one extreme to the other, they shouldn't just jump from a translation that leans strongly toward dynamic equivalence and jump all the way across the spectrum to one that leans strongly toward formal equivalence. But they could switch to a translation that's more in the middle now and kind of move over gradually toward the more literal side. And there are some translations that strive to have a balance between these two extremes. They try to aim for the middle. These translations would be more readable than those that lean strongly toward formal equivalence, but they would be more literal than those that lean strongly towards dynamic equivalence. So there are some benefits to having a translation that's kind of in the middle. And I've found <s>I think</s> that's a good balance for a 5th and 6th grader, 7th graders - that age range. They're not quite ready maybe to go to the hardest translations to read, but they can handle something that is a little bit more difficult and start moving toward a more literal translation.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '10:54', '12:32')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
So this is the tension that bible translators face. It's very hard to make a translation that is both literal and readable. If you want a translation that's more readable its going to be less literal. If you want a translation that's more literal, it's going to be less readable. This is why there is so much diversity among bible translations - they are geared for different levels of readability. And so that effects how literal they are. Now eventually when kids get old enough - 10th, 11th, 12th grade into high school, well now they can handle the translations that lean most strongly towards formal equivalence. These translations are very helpful when you get old enough and when you're mature enough in your Christian faith because there are a close reflection of the original text.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '12:32', '13:20')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
So I do believe that it is very useful and valuable for Christians to have at least one translation that leans strongly toward formal equivalence, at least once they're old enough to be able to handle that - so maybe when they get to high school or for kids who are really good readers, they can maybe do that in middle school as well. But it is valuable to have translations that are more readable as well, not just when you are a child and you can't read very well, but what if you wanted to read faster through the bible as I mentioned here? If you wanted to read faster through the bible, well a translation that leans toward dynamic equivalence will be better. So let's say that you wanted to read through the book of Genesis in one day. Well, if you read a translation that reads strongly toward formal equivalence, you're gonna have to go kind of slowly right? If you read one that's more dynamically equivalent, that leans strongly that way, you'll probably be able to read much faster through it. The comprehension will come more quickly. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '13:20', '14:13')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
So I do you think that it's a good idea to use multiple translations on a regular basis. And so when we get to the end of the study, I'll sort of summarize and review - and then give you my recommendations for what are the best bible translations for different purposes. There are different purposes for using the bible, and there are different translations that are going to be well suited to those different purposes. Now before we start looking at English bible translations in more detail, we need to talk about some of the earliest bible translations that were done in other languages.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '14:13', '14:47')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
English is not the oldest language in the world, far from it, there are many languages that have been in use far longer than English. And the bible was translated into those languages before English even existed. The first bible translation that we know about was made before the bible was even completed. It's called the Septuagint. This is the very first translation of the bible, and it was done even before the new testament was made. It's a translation only of the old testament and it was made during the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C. So it was started in the 3rd century, and then the work on it continued into the 2nd century, as far as we can tell. I can't be exactly certain about the exact date that they started and the exact date they finished, but it seems clear that it was worked on during the 2nd and 3rd of centuries, before Christ came to earth. So this is after the old testament was finished, that took place in the end of the 5th century and maybe the very end of the 4th century or so, probably around 400 BC. But then about 150-200 years later, then they translated the old testament into Greek. And this was shortly after Alexander the Great conquered most of all the known world, when he built up his empire. And as result of that massive empire that Alexander was able to conquer, then the Greek language, which was his language, he was from Macedonia, which was kind of a province of Greece.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '14:47', '16:16')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Well, he spread the Greek language throughout the empire, and so it was the most dominant language in the world for quite some time starting at that point. And so it was very natural for the old testament to be translated into Greek shortly after Alexander setup of his empire. And this translation, the Septuagint, was very popular by the time Jesus arrived on the scene. He would quote from it during his earthly ministry, the apostles often quoted it when they wrote their letters. And so it's no surprise then that the new testament was written in Greek instead of Hebrew. Greek was the main language used in the world at that point including in Palestine, including in Israel. It was very commonly used during that time. So the new testament was written in Greek. And so after the new testament was written, well then the books of the new testament were combined with the Septuagint to form a Greek bible. And this was the predominant bible of the early church for several centuries. You have your translation of the old testament into Greek and so you have to go back to the original Hebrew to get exactly what God had given. But you know the Greek was there, available as a translation, but then you have the original Greek of the new testament right there alongside of the Greek translation of the old testament. And we do have some very old copies of the bible that are totally written in Greek, the Septuagint plus the original new testament. But in the meantime the whole bible began to be translated into other languages as well. And I want to highlight the very first 3 translations - the first 3 languages the bible was translated into besides the old testament of course into Greek, the Septuagint. One of these 3 languages was Syriac. Syriac is an Aramaic dialect and it was used in modern day Syria, but other places as well, there are areas of the middle east, but primarily in Syria - it was used in Damascus the capital of Syria.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '16:16', '18:16')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
The most popular Syriac translation became known as the Peshitta. Maybe you've heard of the Peshitta before, that is the most common Syriac translation of the bible. And it goes back a very early, I think it goes back to the 2nd or 3rd century after Christ, so its a very early translation of the bible shortly after the new testament was finished at the end of the 1st century. Another language the bible was translated into very early on was Coptic. And Coptic was a language that was used primarily in Egypt. And the bible was translated into Coptic very early on as well, I believe that also goes back to the 2nd century. The most significant though of the 3 early languages the bible was translated into was Latin. Latin was used throughout the western part of the Roman empire. So Greek kind of dominated more on the eastern side of the Roman empire because that's where Greece was, that's where the Alexandrian Greek empire was. But on the western side of the Mediterranean, Latin dominated there.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '18:16', '19:16')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
It was originally used in modern day Italy, that of course where the capital city of Italy is located and the capital of the Roman empire as well - the city of Rome. Now at first there were several different Latin bible translations that were made - there were a variety of Latin bible translations, kind of like we have today in English, we have a variety of English translations. But after a while, the leader of the church in Rome decided - you know what, it's time for us to have kind of 1 standard translation. So in the year 382, the leader of the church in Rome commissioned a bible scholar named Jerome to create a new Latin translation of the gospels. And he was actually revising a different translation, but it was different enough we could call it a new translation. And when Jerome finished with the gospels, he just kept going, he kept translating, he translated the other books of the bible, he did get some help from others scholars - it's hard for 1 person to translate the entire bible, especially in those old days when we didn't have computers back then right? So he did get help from others scholars, but eventually the whole bible was completed with Jerome doing the bulk of that work. The Latin translation was finished in the year 405 and it became known as the Vulgate. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '19:16', '20:29')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
The Vulgate, this was a very prominent early translation of the bible finished in 405, the year 405. Just a couple hundred years after the bible was completed. And this Vulgate translation in Latin quickly became the most popular version of the bible in the western part of the Roman empire. And it reigned supreme among bible translations for over a millennium, about 1100 years or so. That's how long it was the dominant translation of the bible and eventually it was recognized as the official bible of the Roman Catholic church. They actually declared that in the 1500s, but it had already been true earlier, they had just never officially declared it. It was the standard translation for years before that. But then in 1500 they declared it to be the standard translation and it remains of the standard Roman Catholic translation until the twentieth century, so not long ago, I think just about 40 years ago or so when they said - okay, this is no longer our standard translation, now people can use a variety of translations if they want to. But for many years it held that very dominate status. But there were 2 events that brought an end to the dominance of the Latin Vulgate. And the first one was the invention of the printing press, that took place in the 15th century, in the mid 1400s, that's when the printing press was invented. The second event that brought an end to the Vulgate's dominance was the protestant reformation in the 16th century. Does anybody remember what year the protestant reformation started? We just celebrated the 500 year anniversary recently, remember what year we did that?
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '20:29', '22:07')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
That was in 2017, so 500 years earlier in the year 1517, and we even can put a date on this. October 31, 1517 - remember what happened on that date? Somebody posted 95 theses to the door of a church in Germany. Remember who did that? Martin Luther did that, he posted 95 theses on the door of the castle church in Wittenberg, Germany.  In these 95 theses Luther was confronting the Roman Catholic church about some of their false beliefs and practices. And this was just the beginning, this was just the tip of the iceberg. Luther continued to criticize the Catholic church for the rest of his life, and there were many others who joined him. That was just beginning - John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli, and many other reformers were calling people to return to the bible instead of following the unbiblical traditions that crept into the Roman Catholic church over time. Eventually a special Latin phrase was used to describe the view of the bible that was held by the reformers. It wasn't coined until after the reformers died, but I think it's an accurate summary of what the reformers believed about the bible. Anybody know what that phrase is - that Latin phrase?
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '22:07', '23:21')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
There are 5 different Latin phrases that we used to summarize the reformation. But there's one that has to do with the bible, remember that one? [a student: Sola scriptura] Yes, Sola scriptura, that means scripture alone. And the point of that phrase is the bible is our final authority for all our beliefs and practices. Only the bible is inspired by God, and so we must come to submit completely to the bible. That is not true about anything else, there is no other source of authority, ultimate authority in our lives besides the bible. Not church tradition, not people's claims to have heard from God. None of those things are authoritative over our lives, only scripture. And so the protestant reformation sparked an explosion of new bible translations with this return to the word of God as primary in the Christian faith. It sparked just massive explosion of bible translations. And of course the fact that the printing press had just been invented in the prior century - that really helped a lot to be able to produce all these different bible translations. So these are the 2 main factors that led to so many new bible translations arriving on the scene in the 1500s.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '23:21', '24:30')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
So Martin Luther started this of course, he was the father of the reformation. He created a new translation of the bible into German very quickly, I think it was 1522 when he finished his German translation of the bible. That was just 5 years after he nailed his 95 theses to the door. So I don't know if he started working on it previously or if he started working on it after that, but you know, withing a short time he had a translation of the bible into German. And it was very good - he went back to the original Greek and the original Hebrew and made a very fine translation into German. And that was just the first domino to fall, there were many other languages that got new bible translations. French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, many other languages in the 1500s and then others in the 1600s. There's all these different translations and of course 1 of these translations was English.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '24:30', '25:15')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
In 1526 William Tyndale published the first printed bible translation in English. It was just the new testament in 1526. And that's how he got it started. He continued working on the old testament, unfortunately though he did not get to finish it because he was condemned as a heretic, and he was arrested and put to death just 10 years after he finished his new testament. So he did not get to finish the whole bible, but he did make some good progress in the old testament. And others scholars had already started to work on the whole bible as well. And so in 1535, the year before Tyndale died, somebody actually published the entire bible. His name was Myles Coverdale. He was the first one to publish the whole bible into English for the first time - 1535 - Myles Coverdale. And his new testament was similar to Tyndale's new testament, but it was a little bit different - he made some changes to it, But he was heavily influenced by Tyndale's new testament.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '25:15', '26:18')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
The Coverdale bible though did not have any of Tyndale's old testament works. Tyndale had been working on the old testament, translating it from the original Hebrew. Coverdale kind of took a short cut in the old testament and he just relied on the Latin. Remember the Vulgate was the predominant translation so he was just translating from Latin into English and that got the old testament done very quickly there, cause people were very familiar with the Latin bible, of course, and could work through that very easily. And so the Coverdale bible was deficient in that way, it was not the best translation that could've been made. So it was kind of a rush job to get the whole bible into the English. But just 2 years later in 1537, there was a new bible translated that met this need, that kind of filled this inadequacy, and this bible was called Matthew's bible. Matthew's bible was put together by a man who called himself Thomas Matthew, but that was not actually his real name. He was a friend of William Tyndale and he knew what happened to Tyndale right for translating the bible. So he decided to use a pseudonym to avoid being put to death. His real name was John Rogers. We have a Jon Rogers at our church, but they spell their names differently, this guy spelled his name with an 'h' - but it makes it easier to remember John Rogers. But we call it Matthew's bible because that was the name that he used when he published this.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '26:18', '27:36')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
So what John Rogers did, is he took Tyndale's new testament, didn't really make any changes to that like Coverdale did in his bible, and then he took the old testament work that Tyndale did and then he added to that whatever Tyndale wasn't able to finish with a translation from the Latin Vulgate. So again still there's some translation from Latin there, but this was an improvement on Coverdale's bible. In 1513, Matthew's bible was revised and this new translation was called the Great bible. And this was the most popular English bible for the next 20 years or so. Unfortunately, there was a major hiccup that took place shortly later in 1553 - somebody new took the throne in English - her name was Mary Tudor. If you've studied your English history you might know her as bloody Mary because she persecuted the protestants. Her sympathies were with the Roman Catholic church and so she prohibited the public reading of scripture during her reign. And she also did not allow any new bibles to be published. Thankfully her reign was short, it only lasted for 5 years. But during her reign, a lot of protestant leaders fled England. A group of them moved to Geneva in Switzerland. Geneva is where John Calvin ministered and he had a great deal of freedom to minister there and teach and to preach. In 1560, the scholars that moved to Geneva, they published a new translation that came to be called the Geneva bible. So here's a summary of the previous translations I mentioned, if you missed any of those and were trying to write them down, here they are for you. I wanted to make sure you had time to write what was on the previous slide there before I jumped forward. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '27:36', '29:15')">audio</a>
</p>





<p class="border1">
So this next bible translation is 21 years later, this was called the Geneva bible. This bible was based on Tyndale's new testament, and it was also based on what Tyndale did in the old testament. But then the rest of the old testament that Tyndale did not get too was translated directly from the Hebrew. So this is the very first bible translation that was completely translated in English from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, & Greek. None of these earlier translations could say that. As you kept going they included more and more translations from the very originals, but all of them were relying on the Latin Vulgate to some degree - the most dominant bible translation at the time. But the Geneva was the first one to be based completely on the original languages all the way through. And so this bible was quite popular for many years. This was the bible that William Shakespeare would most often quote from in his plays - there are lots of biblical references and citations in Shakespeare's plays. And he usually would quote from this bible, the Geneva bible.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '29:15', '30:18')">audio</a>
</p>





<p class="border1">
Some people were not a fan of his bible because the scholars who produced it did it in Geneva, they were under the influence of John Calvin there. And so some of Calvin's theology ended up in this translation, and also some people didn't like it just because it was published outside of England. So there was some resistance to it even though it was very popular, there was resistance to it. And so in 1568 there was another bible translation published called the bishops bible. This was kind of a reaction to the Geneva bible, because the Geneva bible quickly overtook the Great bible and was more popular than it. The bishop's bible was just a revision of the Great bible.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '30:18', '30:57')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
But the people who worked on the bishop's bible were allowed to use some of the things that were in the Geneva bible to try to make some importants, to try to be more appealing to the masses who liked the Geneva bible. But unfortunately the bishop's bible never gained the prominence of the Geneva bible, the Geneva bible continued to be the dominant English translation after the bishop's bible was completed. So this led king James, after he came to the throne in 1603 in England to authorize a new bible translation, and this translation was published in 1611. And of course you all know which one I'm talking about, right? Cause it's named after king James. This was the king James version of the bible. And this is sometimes called the authorized version, and that just simply is a reflection of the fact that it was authorized by the king of England, by king James. He authorized this version - it was suggested to him by someone, and he took this idea and ran with it. He was really keen on the idea of having a translation that he authorized, that he pushed, that would be his legacy basically. But this translation was just basically a revision of the previous translation, it was a revision of the bishop's bible. But more freedom was given here than before to incorporate previous translations like the Geneva bible. The Geneva bible was very popular among lay people.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '30:57', '32:17')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
And so the translators recognized that and said - okay, I guess we've gotta try to follow some of the choices that were made in the Geneva bible. But there were still generally the approach of saying - let's stick with tradition here, let's go with what was in the bishop's bible, the Great bible, and previously. So it did not come all the way over to some of the choices of the Geneva bible that were popular. But there were some adaptations - they were trying to have a balance there between the the bishops bible and Geneva bible. They're trying to end up somewhere in the middle here. And so this revision was appealing to a wide variety of people. It had a wide appeal 'cause it was trying to steer kind of down the center here of the road. And so the king James version soon became the most popular bible translation in English after, you know, a short battle with the Geneva bible. The KJV did come the supreme translation in English, and in fact by the early 1700s, the KJV was basically the only translation of the bible in English that was being used. And that situation continued for quite some time, all the way up into the late 1800s. And so we can conclude here I think by recognizing that Tyndale's new testament has had a massive influence on bible translations for up to 350 years, it was basically the foundation of all the previous English translations, including the KJV. Bible scholars who've compared to these translations to each other, they've concluded that at least 90% of the new testament in the KJV comes directly from the Tyndale new testament. Obviously, it kind of went through a series of changes with these bibles in the middle, but if you just compare Tyndale to the KJV they are very similar - over 90% similar in the new testament.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '32:17', '34:04')">audio</a>
</p>




<p class="border1">
And so we hold a huge debt of gratitude to William Tyndale. He was really the first to jump on this after the protestant reformation. He was a great scholar who knew Greek and Hebrew, and produced a wonderful Greek translation into English of the new testament, and then kept going and did some really good work. And we know from historical records that the reason he was put to death was because he did this translation and he was continuing to work on bible translations. He was condemned as a heretic because he wanted to put the bible in everyday English so that English speaking people could access it directly instead of going through the official church and through the Latin. And so he gave his life to translate the bible into English. We own him and a huge debt of gratitude.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '34:04', '34:49')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Was there a question? Jeff Kasper asked - What kind of bible did the Catholoc church use? The Latin Vulgate. That was the translation of the Roman Catholic church unofficially for many years. And then in the 1500s as sort of reaction to all these new translations in German, in England - English all these other languages. Then they had to come out and say the Latin Vulgate is the official translation. And that continued into 1979, when they finally decided to say - okay, it's no longer the official translation, and they gave a little more freedom. So they held onto that for a long time, but the Latin Vulgate had already fallen from its place as top dog in translations much earlier than that because of all these new translations that were happening in different languages.

<p class="border1">
Now the KJV of course, is a translation we want to focus quite a bit of attention on because it is still very popular today. It's not the number one most popular translation any more. But it was for many years even until the 1900s, the mid 1900s. So we want to talk a lot about this, but I think I need a full session for that. So we will come back to the KJV and go into it in much greater detail next week. And in the rest of our time to today, I want to take a bit of a detour and talk about a problem with these early English bible translations. The problem that I want to talk about - there are other problems we can talk about later - but the problem I want to focus on here has to do with the order of the books of the bible. Most of you are familiar with the order of the books of the bible that we have in our bibles today.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '35:37', '36:25')">audio</a>

<p class="border1">
But I do want to do some review. Its important for us to keep this information fresh in our minds, so if you have learned it, it's good every once in a while to review this and make sure that you remember the order of the books in our English bibles. Some of you may not know the order of the books in English quite yet, and that's a good thing to learn, so let's take a little bit of time to walk through the books of the bible in English. I'd love to put them on the screen for you but I don't think there would be room. If I were to make room, I'd have to make them too small for most of you to read, especially if you're in the back.

<p>************************************HANDOUT PENDING, not yet included *********************************</p>

<p class="border1">
So I created a handout, actually I've created this handout in the past, I just made a few tweaks to it to update it. Go ahead and take one of these and let's just kind of walk through the English order of the old and new testament. The English is on one side here, the new testament is on the other side. You can of course go to the table of contents in your bible as well, but I decided to add a pronunciation guide here, just so we can make sure we're pronouncing all these books consistently, this is the standard way to pronounce the books here. I didn't follow like some sort of scholarly pronunciation guide, it just more of a popular kind of pronunciation. I'm sure I can make some adjustments to this to improve it. Hopefully this will be helpful. Now, notice first of all here that the bible is of course divided into two parts. We're taking that for granted up to this point - we talked about the old and new testaments - these are the 2 major parts of the bible. Let's go through that old testament first. There are 39 books in the old testament and they can be divided into 4 major sections. This is the standard approach to dividing the books in the English old testament. We have these 4 sections - the law, books of history, books of poetry, and books of prophecy.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '36:56', '38:11')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
So in the law we have five books [books spoken]. And the we have 12 books of history in our English old testament [books listed]. Then we have 5 books of poetry starting with [books listed]. Some bibles refer to it [song of songs] as song of Solomon, so it just depends on which translation your using, as how they title that, there are 2 different titles that are used for that in English. Then we end with 17 books of prophecy and most will divide this into 2 sections, we have our major prophets, and our minor prophets. So we have 5 books in the major prophets [books listed]. And then we have 12 minor prophets [books listed]. Now maybe some of you learned Haggai and Hag-ee-i, that's not the correct pronunciation in English, that's a butchering there of the diphthong at the end of that word. It should be pronounced Ha-guy instead of Hag-ee-i. I learned it as Hag-ee-i growing up and I had to rid myself of that pronunciation when I got older and and got wiser, and realized - oh wait a second it's not Hagg-ee-I its Ha-guy. So I just want to point that out cause some of you may have learned it like I did and gotten it wrong. If you went though the AWANA program, you probably got it wrong - that's how I was taught through the AWANA program - I learned all the books in order, but I learned that pronunciation incorrectly there. So those are the books of the English old testament, the order that they're found in, and how there are usually organized. Most people agree that we have these 4 sections, and these 2 sub-sections under the books of prophecy. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '38:11', '40:02')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Now flip that over and let's look quickly at the new testament. In the new testament, we have 27 books, and these can also be divided into 4 sections. There's not uniformity in how thee are divided, some would combine those first 2 sections, but most I think would divide them. So first we have 4 gospels [books listed]. And then we have one book of church history called Acts. And we have 21 letters and we can divide these into 2 sections - we have Paul's letters first, 13 of those, and then we have 8 general letters. So Paul's letters are in the order of [books listed]. And then we have 8 general letters written by a variety of different authors - nobody wrote anywhere close to as many letters as Paul did, and so they just kind of got stuck together in this section. We start with [books listed]. And then finally at the end we have this book of prophecy here called Revelation, and that's a section all by itself there, at the very end.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '40:02', '41:12')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
So that's usually how we divide the new testament books and that's the order that is used in our English bibles. If you've never memorized the order of the old and new testament books in our English bible, I encourage you to do that. I think it's worth your time to do that, that way if you're using a paper bible you don't have to go the table of contents and find the right page number for your book. You can to start flipping through it and you'll know - Oh I need to keep going forward or I need to back up now, I need to back up a lot, or I need to go forward a lot, and you can quickly hone in on where that book of the bible is. We train our kids here at the church in different settings to do sword drills where they hold up their bible, we give them a reference, and then say go and then they try to find it as fast as they can. Some of these kids can find scripture passage is just a couple seconds - they're really quick. And that's cause they've memorized these books in order. That's one of things that we teach the kids to do still in AWANA here at our church. So if you didn't get to go through AWANA for whatever reason, then you can sort of try to catch up on some of things that our kids learned in AWANA and just use this as a guide to you. Learn the old testament first, well you could learn the new testament first, it is easier, case there's fewer books, so however you wanna go about it. I would encourage you to learn these books in order.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '41:12', '42:22')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
But we do have a problem with the order all the old testament books here. The order in our English old testament is not the same order that's used in the Hebrew bible. As the bible was translated into different languages, as we discussed earlier, the order of the books was changed over time. And that actually started with the very first translation of the bible, the book order was changed, when the bible was first translated. What translation are we talking about again? What was the first translation? The Greek Septuagint, right. When the old testament was translated into Greek before Jesus came to earth, a new order for the books was used. It's not exactly the order that we have in our English bibles today, but the same basic structure was used. The Greek old testament can be divided into the same 4 sections that we have - law, history, poetry, and prophets. So even though the order is not exactly the same, it's very similar because they're following these same divisions. Then when the bible was translated into Latin in the Latin Vulgate, the order of books changed again. The same 4 sections were used for the old testament, but the order shifted slightly and this order that's found in the Vulgate is the same one that is used in all the major English bible translations that have been used from the 1500s all the way to today. The Latin Vulgate had a very strong influence on all these translations. And we can see that through the order of the books of the old testament. But the order of the books in the Hebrew bible is quite a bit different and I think it's worth our time to take a look at this order in the Hebrew old testament.  
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '42:22', '44:05')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Go ahead and take this handout. On the back side I've given an alternate order for the New Testament and we'll talk about that a bit later. So don't go to that side first. Let's focus on the old testament in Hebrew first - this is the more important one to focus on. The bible was originally written in Hebrew so we should care greatly about the order that was used in the Hebrew bible. So let's walk through this quick. Some of you are familiar with this already because I've taught about this in other settings, but I'm sure most of you probably have not heard this before and it is worth knowing about. So as you can see here in Hebrew old testament there are only 3 major sections instead of the 4 that we have in our English bibles. And these sections are called the law, the prophets, and the writings. And we can actually find a reference to these 3 sections in scripture. I put at the bottom of the page there Luke 24:44. In that verse Jesus mentioned the law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms. So clearly he was referring to the first 2 sections in the Hebrew bible there. Now we don't have a direct reference the 3rd section, he didn't refer to the writings, but he did refer to the Psalms. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '44:05', '45:23')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
And if you look there at the writings you'll see the very first book in that section of writings is the book of Psalms. I think instead of referring to writings he just referred to Psalms because that's the most important book in the writings. Its the predominant book, it leads off lot that section, and the book of Psalms does often point forward to Jesus. There are many connections between Jesus and the book of Psalms and Jesus knew that of course and so I think he wanted to hone in on this very first book of the writings. So I do think its obvious that Jesus was referring to these 3 sections in the Hebrew bible even though he changed the way that people would describe the 3rd section there. I think he was still referring to that 3rd section there. And so this was the way that Jesus viewed the old testament. We don't have any references to Jesus of viewing the old testament the way that it was arranged in the Greek Septuagint. He was talking about it the way it was structured in the Hebrew bible. And I don't know about you, but if this structure was good enough for Jesus, it is good enough for me. I think this is the best way to view the old testament - the way that Jesus spoke about it her in Luke 24:44.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '45:23', '46:26')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
So let's walk through these sections here - the law, the prophets, and the writings - and we'll kind of observe how the order here is different from what's in our English bible today, that we just walked through. Notice right away that that we have the same thing in the beginning, we have a section called the law in both, and we have the same 5 books in the same order [books listed]. So that's a nice way to start right, a lot of similarity there to our English bible, nothing really changed there going from Hebrew into English. But then when you move into the next section now we have some differences right? Our next section is called history; they called their next section the prophets. Now in our books of prophets we see Isaiah, Jeremiah and so on - so that's kind of what we would expect to see, right? But we don't, instead right away there we have Joshua and Judges just like we have in our English bible, its the same next 2 books, but instead of thinking of them as history books, the Israelites thought of them as books of prophecy. Its not to say that they aren't recording history, that are recording history. But the Hebrew's did not think of them just simply as history books - they though of them as God's perspective on these historical events. These books were written by prophets and the same thing is true for the next 2 books as well - Samuel and Kings. Notice Ruth is not here. Ruth is in some other place in the Hebrew order. Instead we just jump right into Samuel and Kings, jump over Ruth. And notice also that it's not called 1st and 2nd Samuel or 1st and 2nd Kings, but just Samuel, just Kings. What happened here is that originally these were 1 book each - Samuel and Kings. But then when the books were translated into Greek, they had to divide them into 2, because Greek is not as compact of a language as Hebrew. Hebrew is a very compact language, you can say a lot in a little bit of space. When you translate into another language it gets to be about twice as long. So they had to divide these into 2 books to fit them on scrolls - that' where the 1st and 2nd Samuel and the 1st and 2nd Kings came from. But originally they were viewed as 1 book and that's the way that we should think of them as well, we should think of them as 1 book each there. And so these 4 books are what they would think of as the former prophets.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '46:26', '48:37')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Then we have 4 books called the latter prophets and this is where we get into the books that we think of as the books of the prophets - we have Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the 12. And the 12 there is just a collection of what we think of as a 12 minor prophets and is very nice that they're in exactly the same order. Could you imagine trying to learn the 12 minor prophets in a completely different order? That would be very challenging, right? Its hard enough to learn them in the English order - that's the hardest part of learning the bible I think, the order books, is learning these 12 minor prophets in the right order. In Hebrew, they're in the same order, so they didn't get changed when they were brought into English. But the Hebrews did view these as a collection - 1 book with 12 books inside of it, kind of like the bible - 1 book with 66 books in there, that's how we think of it. Same thing here, we have 1 book that has 12 smaller books inside of it. We don't really think of the 12 minor prophets in that way, but that's the way they thought of it. Notice there are 2 books missing that are in our prophets section. Does anybody know which 2 books are missing? You know your books of the bible really well, which 2 books are missing here, in the latter prophets that we have in our section called the prophets? Yeah, Daniel / Lamentations are missing.

<p class="border1">
They are not in the prophets in this Hebrew bible here, but in the writings. And it's not too hard I think to see why. Lamentations was not really a book of prophecies, it was certainly written by a prophet, but it's just a lament over the fall of Jerusalem. It doesn't really have any sort of predictions or anything like that. The book of Daniel is in a similar situation, it was written by a prophet, the prophet Daniel. And it does have some prophecies in it as well, but the Israelites decided to view it as a book of history because these prophecies were focused on future historical events. And of course there are some past events that are recorded there as well regarding the person of Daniel. So it kind of a mix of history and prophecy, and they decide to view it as a book of history. So Daniel and Lamentations are not in the prophets section, they are in the writings section. So are the 5 books of poetry in our English bible, so are the rest of those books of history - 1st and 2nd Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther - those are all in the writings as well. And so it would be easy for us to think - this writing section is just a complete mess here, right? How are we to work our way through this? Well, I think the order of the writings is just absolutely brilliant if you really stop and think about what's going on here. Psalms is the perfect book to start this section. The book of Psalms is basically a miniature old testament in poetical form because it was written over a very long period. You have Moses writing a Psalm and then you have very late writers after the return from captivity writing psalms. So it covers a large a period of Israelite history, written over a long period of time.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '49:48', '51:20')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Job is an appropriate next book because it tells the story of a man who probably lived very early on, probably even before the time of Abraham. And so it's very appropriate to have this right after the book of Psalms. Proverbs follows very naturally after Job because they both talk about the theme of wisdom. Job chapter 28:28 says that the fear of the Lord is wisdom. You thought that was only in Proverbs, right? No, Job wrote about this first and I think Solomon was probably thinking about Job when he wrote about how the fear of the Lord is wisdom. He wrote about that in a couple different places in the book of Proverbs - at the very beginning in Proverbs 1:7 and also a little bit later in Proverbs 9:10. He basically repeated himself. So I think Solomon was a drawing from Job 28 when he wrote those statements. And so it's very useful for us to have these books side by side to remind us about that connection. So these 3 books form the poetry section in the writings, these big books of poetry, and then we have five festival scrolls here in the Hebrew bible. The 1st one is Ruth, the one that we skipped over earlier after the book of Judges. Originally this was here in the writings, and I love its location the Hebrew bible. It comes right after the book of Proverbs. If you know anything about the book of Proverbs you know what comes at the end of that book, right? You have a description of this wife of noble character. Well where can we find an example of this - the book on the Ruth. In the book of Ruth, she is called a woman of noble character, using the same Hebrew word that's found at the end of the book of Proverbs. So there is a very strong link between these books. We know of course Ruth got married to Boaz, and so it's natural that this love story could then be followed by a love poem - the song of songs was basically a love poem. So this fits very nicely after the book of Ruth. And then we have Ecclesiastes next, which is also written by Solomon in our bible there in reverse order. But this is probably the better order it seems as though Solomon wrote Ecclesiastes at the very end of his life, just looking back at everything he learned in his life. And he has some wise words to say there at the end. So I think song of songs and then Ecclesiastes is the better order.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '51:20', '53:26')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Then we have the book of Lamentations. This follows nicely after Ecclesiastes cause these 2 books are probably the 2 most pessimistic books in the old testament. But we do see in Lamentations that there are some words of hope there in the middle of the book. That's where we get our song great is thy faithfulness from. This phrase comes from the middle of the book of Lamentations, so there is a note of hope in there. And that leads naturally to Esther because Esther brought hope and salvation to the Israelites when someone tried to destroy them. So these 5 festival scrolls are in a very logical order, there are close connections between them, and they're also in chronological order as well. This is the order in which they were written. Notice I indented these books that were in the middle of the 5 festival scrolls, cause I wanted you to see that there is also some parallels between some of these. Ruth, Esther I kept to the far left because I think they are similar to each other. They were both written by women and focused on women here.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '53:26', '54:21')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Then we have song of songs and Lamentations matching up each other because they're both these amazing works of poetry. These are 2 of the most amazing works of poetry that have ever been produced in the world. Its fascinating to study these books and to be able to understand what is going on in the poetry in the original Hebrew - it's fascinating to do that. In the center there we have Ecclesiastes which kind of stands by itself in the middle here. Its a mixture of narrative and poetry. Ruth and Esther were narratives, song of songs, Lamentations are poetry, Ecclesiastes has some of both, and it's basically this gripping work of philosophy in which Solomon is exploring the meaning of life. So this is an appropriate place to put Ecclesiastes - just right in the middle here. After the Hebrew books here of the festival scrolls - these were just read at the different festivals that the Hebrew's would celebrate, each one had a different festival - then we end the old testament with 3 books of history. Daniel is the first, it falls very nicely after Esther cause both of these individuals were political leaders in foreign governments, so its very natural to read them side-by-side. After Daniel we have Ezra and Nehemiah together combined into one book, and this book of Ezra and Nehemiah - this book records the final events of old testament history. But Chronicles comes last because it was probably the last book of the old testament to be written. It has some very late genealogies recorded in it. And I do think it's natural to put this last because it reviews old testament history - it goes all the way back to Adam and then it kind of traces things all the way up to recent times. so this is a good way of reviewing old testament history, at the very end of the old testament.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '54:21', '55:54')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
The beginning of the writings has kind of an overview of the old testament spoken in poetry. At the end we have Chronicles which reviews the old testament in narrative form. So you can see the Hebrew old testament is quite a bit different from our English old testament. There are only 3 main sections instead of 4, and we only have 24 books in the Hebrew bible. Its all the same material, but they just thought of some books as being combined, like Chronicles is also combined just like Ezra and Nehemiah there.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '55:54', '56:20')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
So when you combine the multiple books that we are in English into single books, now you end up up with only 24 books. But this is the most authentic way to view the old testament. And I highly recommend that you read through the old testament using this order some time. If you'd like some help with that, just take the old testament survey courses with me, in the bible institute, because this is the order that were using. This fall we're going to be jumping into the writings - and we're going to read the first 3 books of the writings in that order - Psalms, Job, and Proverbs.

Now flip over quickly and I'll just hit the highlights on the new testament books. The new testament books have basically been in the same order since they were collected together in the 4th century, but I don't think that this order is authoritative. We don't have a word from Jesus about this. And so I think we can come up with a better order and that's what I've done on the reverse side there. All I did was I started by separating the gospels. I don't think it makes a lot of sense to read the 4 gospels all consecutively cause it starts to feel redundant after a while. I'm just taking a cue from the Hebrew bible. The Hebrew bible doesn't put Chronicles after Samuel and Kings because they're very similar, they have some of the same events. They're separated instead. So that's what I'd like to do with the gospels, I just separated them all out so that none of them are back to back. And what this allows us to do is to fix the biggest problem with the new testament book order, and that is to put Luke and Acts together where they belong.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '56:48', '57:37')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Luke and Acts were both written by Luke and they were written to be a 2 volume history of early Christianity. I suspect Luke originally intended to write 1 book but he just ran out space on his scroll, he needed to have a 2nd scroll, so he had that 2nd scroll. But these are meant to be read together back to back, and they should be put together back to back in the bible was well I believe. Then what I did is I just took all the new testament letters and tried to figure out which gospel they should be attached to. All the gospels have close connections to other books in the new testament. And so I just created 4 groups the books here, each one starting with the different gospel.  And I named each group after the main author in that group. So I started with Matthew here just like we have our bibles. The early church leaders believe Matthew was the first gospel to be written and I agree with them. Many modern scholars don't agree with that, I think the early church scholars had it right - Matthew was the first gospel to be written.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '57:36', '58:28')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Then I put James here as the letter to go with the book of history here, with that gospel, because James was probably written around the same time as Matthew. It was probably the very first letter to be written in the new testament. And when we compare James and Matthew we see a great deal of similarities. First of all, both were written to Jewish believers. Most other books were not written to Jewish believers specifically, but these 2 were. And then if you compare the book of James to the sermon on the mount, in Matthew 5-7, there are amazing similarities, just as you go through the book of James. That's a fascinating thing to do. Read the sermon on the mount alongside the book of James sometime and you'll be blown away at how many similarities there are. So I suspect that James wrote his letter with the sermon on the mount in mind, almost as a bit of a commentary on the sermon on the mount. The next gospel I put here is Luke, not Mark. I believe Luke was written before Mark and most of the earliest church scholars agree with that. It was only later scholars who changed that and decide to put Mark earlier and that's why it's in that order.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '58:28', '59:25')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
After the book of Acts here with Luke, I then include all of Paul's letters. And that's because Paul and Luke were very connected, they were ministry companions. Luke traveled with Paul on some all of his missionary journeys. Paul even quoted from Luke's gospel in 1 Timothy 5;18 as though he's putting his stamp of approval on it, to say I recognize this as inspired scripture. Now thankfully Paul's letters are all together in our English bibles, but I don't think the order in our English bible is very helpful. They are basically arranged into 2 groups - letters to churches and then letters to individuals. And then within those 2 groups they're organized from longest to shortest. Have you ever noticed that they kind of start with the longer ones and moved to the shorter ones? What is the point of that? That is not very helpful. I think it would be better to arrange them chronologically, so I put the 13 letters of Paul in chronological order there. There are times when we can't be certain about the precise chronological order.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '59:25', '01:00:16')">audio</a>
</p>




<p class="border1">
The first 6 scholars are pretty certain about those. That's the right chronological order for the first 6 - from Galatians through Romans. After that we have 4 letters written while Paul was in prison, and its very hard to know what order he wrote them in, so I just tried to put them in an order that's logical - Ephesians and Colossians are sister letters. Colossians and Philemon were probably sent at the same time to the same area. Philippians seems to have be written when Paul was optimistic about being released, so I suspect that was probably the last of the 4 letters he wrote in prison in Rome, and then he got released after that. And then he wrote Titus and 1 Timothy. Again its hard to know which one he wrote first, but I like putting Titus first because then we can put 1st and 2nd Timothy together.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '01:00:16', '01:00:53')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Paul very clearly wrote 2 Timothy at the very end of his life after he was returned back to prison and he knew when he wrote a letter that he was gonna die soon, so that's his very last letter. I just threw Hebrews in here because most scholars think either Paul or Luke wrote it - I'm inclined to think Luke wrote it, probably after Paul died, but we don't know for sure cause there's no author's name attached to it. But I think there are many good reasons for thinking Luke wrote it, so it belongs here, because we have Luke and Acts here in this section as well.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '01:00:53', '01:01:20')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
In Peter's group here, we have Mark's gospel which is the next gospel to be written, and then we attach Peter's letters because Peter made reference to Mark at the end of his first letter. So they were connected together, and most early bible scholars think that Mark was based on Peter's preaching, that's what the earliest bible scholars tell us. Jude is very similar to 2nd Peter, they have a lot of the same themes in there, so that's a natural fit next to 2nd Peter, separated in our bible unfortunately. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '01:01:20', '01:01:48')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
We end with John's group, these are the 5 books written at the end. They were the last 5 books to be written in the bible, so its good to put them together. They were all written by John. I like how we can read John and 1 John back to back in this order. 1 John was probably written as a follow up to the gospel of John just to help people who were confused after they read the gospel of John, and answer some follow up questions. There are many similar themes in those 2. And then after 2nd and 3rd John, we have Revelation, this was the very last book of the bible to be written, and the last book John wrote as well. So I like having the 5 books of John all together in a group, because there are many connections between those. So I do think this is a better order to read the new testament in - I can't point to Jesus as an authority for this like I can with the Hebrew bible, cause he referred to the order of the Hebrew bible there. But I do think that there are many good qualities of this order. This is the order that we're going to be using when we go through the new testament in the bible institute. So invite you to join us when we read through the bible in the new testament in this order in a couple of years in the new testament. But whatever order you read the bible in, what is most important is just to be reading of the bible. The bible is God's revelation to us, it tells us everything we need to know so that we can please God. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt1, '01:01:48', '01:02:55')">audio</a>
</p>




<p class="border1">
So let's close in prayer. Thank you Lord for your word. Thank you for preserving it for us. Thank you for the privilege of being able to read it and hear directly from you. We don't need any additional revelation, we know scripture is complete, and that you tell us everything we need to know to live in a way that pleases you. So I pray that we would be motivated to spend time in your word this week. In Jesus' name. Amen.
