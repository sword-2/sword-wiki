<h3 id="review">Review</h3>

<b>King James Version (KJV):</b>
<p class="border1">
Well we're now in the middle of our study of bible translations approaching at the half way point. We are now in our 7th week. So far though we've only covered one bible translation that I can recommend to you. We started with the KJV, at least that was the first major translation that we looked at in English. And I was not able to recommend that one because of all the obsolete language in it, and because it is also based on inferior manuscript support in the new testament. So even though it remains a popular translation today, I don't think it is quite good enough for regular use today - there are much better choices available.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '00:00', '00:36')">audio</a>
</p>

<b>American Standard Version (ASV):</b>
<p class="border1">
Then we looked at the ASV which is better than the KJV - its based on better manuscript support - but the problem with the ASV is it was just as hard to read as the KJV. It continued to have a lot of obsolete language. And so I can't recommend the ASV either.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '00:36', '00:53')">audio</a>
</p>

<b>Revised Standard Version (RSV):</b>
<p class="border1">
Then we looked at the RSV which was published in 1952. And thankfully that translation was a lot more readable than either the KJV or the ASV, but it did still have some obsolete language. There were some archaic pronouns that were used in reference to God. That's not a huge issue cause that doesn't cover most of the bible. The big problem with the RSV was theological. It had a lot of theological problems and bible believing conservative Christians rightly criticized that translation and decided "we're not going to use this". So I can't recommend the RSV to you either. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '00:53', '01:29')">audio</a>
</p>

<b>New American Standard Version (NASB):</b>

<p class="border1">
Thankfully the next major bible translation that we looked at avoided those theological problems in the RSV. We're talking about the NASB which we've looked at over the last 2 weeks. This translation was published in 1971 and then was revised in 1977. Now those 2 editions did have some obsolete language - they had archaic pronouns referring to God, but then there was a new edition of the NASB that was released in 1995 and all those archaic pronouns were thankfully removed. And so this translation became a lot more readable in 1995. Then just a few years ago there was another revision in 2020, and this is the current edition now of the NASB. So whenever I refer to the NASB, and I put it up on the screen, unless I put a year with it, I am referring to the 2020 NASB, the most current edition of the NASB. And last week we compared the 2020 NASB to the previous edition, the one that I grew up using, the 1995 NASB. And we looked at 11 different passages, and in all of those passages I thought the NASB was better in the 2020 edition. They made some significant improvements. So for example we saw last week that the 2020 NASB is more gender sensitive. The 95 NASB and the previous editions had a lot of masculine language that just wasn't really based on the original text. And so the translators I think wisely updated the 2020 NASB to not be just so masculine heavy. So for example they changed the word brethren to the phrase brothers and sisters. They would often change the word man to the word person if the context allowed for that. Sometimes they would change the word he to the word one. So instead of saying he who does this they would save the one who does this. So that's more gender sensitive. And all of those changes I think we're allowed in the original text, there was nothing masculine in the original text that dictated the way it had been previously translated. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '01:29', '03:29')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
There were many other good changes in the 2020 NASB that we saw. Many of them resulted in smoother and more readable English, so we saw a place in the Psalms where the NASB had the phrase "be not envious" in the 95 edition. And thankfully the 2020 NASB has a smoother way of saying that - do not be envious. The NASB has the phrase "this you know" in the book of James. It sounds like Yoda from star wars is talking to us. "Or did this you know" - sounds like something he [Yoda] would say. But that's not normal English. Instead we would say "you know this" - subject, verb, direct object and that's what the 2020 NASB has.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '03:29', '04:06')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Many places in the NASB used to have the word shall, which is kind of an old archaic word that we don't use so much anymore. And the NASB in 2020 starts to shift away from that word and changed many of those shalls to wills instead. We say the word will instead of the word shall these days. Some changes in the 2020 NASB just result in better interpretation of scripture, so for example in Matthew chapter 19, we saw Jesus talking about an exception for a husband and a wife getting divorced. Divorce is not normally allowed, but under certain situations divorce is allowed, and the older NASB editions starting in the 70s and up to the 90s, they talked about how Jesus was permitting divorce for simply immorality. Well, immorality is too general of a word - that can refer to wickedness the general. The Greek word there was referring to sexual immorality, and so the 2020 NASB ads that word sexual there to make that more clear, so its not misleading people into thinking Oh I can just get a divorce because my spouse is wicked - no that's not allowed. It has to be specific types of wickedness.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '04:06', '05:11')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
In 1 Corinthians chapter 7, the 95 NASB and the older editions refer to a man's virgin daughter. The word daughter is in italics there to show that its an interpretation, its added, its not part of the original text. But it's not a very good interpretation. Paul was probably talking about a man who was engaged to a virgin instead. And so 2020 NASB just deletes that word daughter, it takes it out and leaves it more open. It could refer to a daughter, it could refer to a fiancee instead. Most scholars think it refers to a man's fiancee, a woman he's engaged to, a virgin woman, and that's more likely I think, so this is a good change. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '05:11', '05:47')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
We also looked at a verse in 1 John chapter 3 where the older NASB seems to indicate that if you are sinning at all then you are not born of God. And that's kind of troubling because in chapter 1 John said that if you claim to be without sin you are deceiving yourself. O, so can no one be saved then? No, chapter 3 is not referring to sinning at all, it's referring to the practice of sin, habitual sin, continual sin. And so the 2020 NASB makes a little change there and puts the word continually in italics to help us understand what is John really talking about here. That's the proper interpretation I think. If you don't put a word like that there it can definately confuse and mislead people. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '05:47', '06:28')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Now I'm not saying I love everything about the NASB - I'm sure I can find some verses in the 2020 NASB that I'm not a huge fan of. It was hard to find them last week when I was researching - I do like most of the changes. There are some features of the NASB I'm not a huge fan of, and these are things that have been part of the NASB from the beginning. They capitalize pronouns that refer to God. They put words in italics that aren't based directly on the original text. Well the problem with that is italics usually convey emphasis in modern English. That's not the meaning of the italics though in the NASB, so that's a little bit misleading. We saw last week that the NASB uses all caps for old testament quotations. And so whenever the old testament is being quoted, if somebody is reading that, they're going to think that they're being shouted at. And that's not the idea there. That not what the NASB translators are trying to communicate. So I don't mind them emphasizing old testament quotes, I don't mind them putting words in brackets or doing something to words that come from the original text, but why italics, and why use all caps? Those don't seem like very smart decisions to me. Hopefully in a future edition they will make a change and decide you know we shouldn't use italics - we shouldn't use all caps - let's find some other way of doing what we wanna do here. But you know these flaws are minor, and they don't keep me for recommending the NASB. I think this is one of the best English translations available today - definitely something that you want to have available to consult as you study God's word. And one of the best features of the NASB is it's pretty literal. That makes it very valuable for careful bible study - when your really wanting to dig into the individual words in the bible, the NASB is a translation that will really help you a lot.

<b>Numbers to compare translations:</b>

<p class="border1">
Now when we started our study on bible translations, I told you that I would be putting all the translations that I cover on a spectrum between 1 and 100 with 1 representing perfect formal equivalence and 100 representing perfect dynamic equivalence. So what that just means is the lower the number is, the more literal the translation is. So you might remember me talking about this a few weeks ago, but I haven't really delivered on my promise yet have I? I haven't assigned any numbers to any bible translations. So it is now time for me to start delivering on my promise. Here are the numbers that I would assign to the translations we've covered so far. And lets work our way backwards, lets start with the NASB and work our way back to the KJV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '08:05', '08:52')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1"> 
I would put the NASB at the number 17. So between 1 and 100 I would put it at the number 17. And you might think that's a kind of random number - well this past week I went through, and looked at all the translations I'm going to be covering in this class, I'll assign them all different numbers. Cause I told you I don't need to assign the same number to any two translations. So that means we're just gonna have to sort of some oddball numbers in there, they're not going to be round numbers or anything like that. So the NASB ends up at a 17 - I actually started a little lower than that, then I decided to move it up. This is the 2020 NASB. Older editions of the NASB might be a little bit lower than that, like the 1977 edition, but that's not available anymore, except on line I guess, you can find it online. That's not in print - this is the current NASB. So I would put it at a the 17. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that may seem sort of high, didn't I just say it's a pretty literal translation? Well, yes, but remember that even the most literal bible translations still incorporate some dynamic equivalence. And so I'm not going to give any translation a number below 10. Ten will be the lowest number that I assign to any translation, because even those most literal translation are going to use some amount of dynamic equivalence. Now notice that I also put a reading level here. This comes out at about a 10th grade reading level. So I just want you see, not only how the literal is it, but how easy is it to read as well. And usually the lower the number is on this 1 to 100 spectrum, the higher the grade level will be. In general, there will be some exceptions to that, but usually the more literal a translation is the harder it is to read. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now some bible scholars, and you can find this still today if you search for this, Christian book does this and several other websites - they assign 11th grade reading level to the NASB. And as I've look at it carefully, I don't agree with that, I think that probably was assigned to the NASB way back in the 70s when it was first released. And it was harder to read back in the 70s with all those archaic pronouns. It is become easier to read and so I'm comfortable moving it up to 10th grade. I think it is easier to read then it once was. And I'll be putting several other translations at the 10th grade level as well, some of our more liberal bible translations. I think especially in the 2020 edition, it's become as easy to read as it ever has been. It's still not the easiest translation to read, but it's easier then it used to be.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '08:52', '11:13')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Now we also covered the RSV. And I would put that translation at the number 22. So in other words, it is not quite as literal as the NASB, but it is still definitely on the more literal side of the spectrum here. Notice that I put this translation at an 11th grade reading level, which is a little weird. Why is it less literal but harder to read?  Remember those archaic pronouns in the RSV? That's what kind of drags down the readability of this translation. There's also some other obsolete language in it as well. It is after all 70 years old now, so it's not super readable for modern people today. So I would assign that an 11th grade reading level.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '11:13', '11:55')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Yeah - question. What's the reading level for a KJV? We'll get to that - it's gonna be higher.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '11:55', '12:01')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Now let's talk about the ASV. Most bible scholars say that the ASV is actually the most literal bible translation that's ever been published. And I used to say that as well, but after looking at things a little more carefully this past week, I would not go quite that far. I would say that it's very literal and one of the most literal translations, but I do think there's at lease 1 translation that's more literal than the ASV, and we'll actually be covering up one later in the class. But I would say the ASV is more literal than the NASB, the current edition at least, so I would put it at a little lower number then the 17 - I would drop this down to 12. I'll have one translation that I'll put at a 10, and this one is in second place right behind that one. This one comes out at a 12. And this is a very hard translation to read, even harder than the RSV, its just full of archaic pronouns and just an older translation. So this comes out at a 12th grade reading level.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '12:04', '12:58')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Finally, lets talk about the KJV. I would put the KJV at the number 15. And I've gone back and forth on this one. Is it more literal than the NASB or less literal? Different people say different things, but I looked at enough passages and compared them where I'm comfortable dropping the KJV a little bit lower then the current edition of the NASB. It's just a tiny bit more literal. And I'll actually put another translation right in between them. So there's going to be a couple translations are very similar in terms of how literal they are - with just some very small differences. But it is not as literal as the ASV. The ASV took it up a notch in terms of literalness. The KJV I would probably mark it even higher, but I think 12th grade is the highest reading level that gets assigned to any translations. So even though it's harder to read than the ASV, I'll just let them share the 12th grade reading level here. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '12:58', '13:48')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Alright, we're now ready to move on to our next bible translation. I've caught you up on these numbers I promised to give you, I've given reading levels for these translations, and we'll continue to do this with the new translations that we cover as well. And so by the end will cover something like 15 translations and I'll have a number on the spectrum for you for each one and then the reading level for each one, and that will help you to decide which translations you might want to check into, and which ones you might use. Just some of the features that helps us to compare translations to each other. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '13:48', '14:18')">audio</a>
</p>


<h3 id="NIV-intro">New International Version (NIV) - introduction </h3>

<p class="border1">
So let's look at our next bible translation. This next translation followed closely on the heels of the NASB. The NASB was published in 1971. And this next translation was published just a few years later. It's called the New International Version (NIV). It was first published in 1973 with just the new testament and then in 1978 the whole bible was finished. So that was just seven years after the NASB. There was a minor revision that was done in 1984. That's very similar to what we saw with the NASB - that got revised in 1977. And then I just kept referring to the 77 edition. I'll do that with the NIV as well, I'll just refer to the 84 edition because the 78 edition didn't get used for very long. The 84 edition was the one that really rose in prominence and was used widely. Now actually the NIV was originally conceived all the way back in 1955. There was a business man named Howard Long who would travel around and share the gospel with fellow business people, and he became frustrated that he was having to use the KJV to share the gospel with people. I think he knew better than to use the RSV, and he didn't want to use the ASV, because that was not any more readable than the KJV. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '14:18', '15:38')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So there just weren't really any good options back in the 50s. He had to use the KJV and he was struggling with all the archaic language in it, trying to help people to understand this. And so Howard Long petitioned his denomination, I think it was the christian reformed church, that denomination that he was part of, and he first talked to his pastor at his local church, and eventually they petitioned the denomination that they were part of, to look into the possibility of developing a brand new bible translation in contemporary English. In other words, making it much, much more readable than the KJV. And after several denials from first the denomination, and then the larger Christian world, eventually a decision was reached to move forward with a new bible translation. That happened 10 years later in 1965. There were a couple different groups who came together including the denomination that Howard Long was part of, and then another group of evangelicals, and they agreed - OK lets work together and lets partner together to make a new bible translation. And in 1967 these groups established a committee to begin working on the new translation. They found 15 bible scholars who were very conservative, but they were part of different denominations. They came from different backgrounds, but they all believed in the authority of scripture, they had a high view of God. So they were solid conservatives scholars, and these 15 scholars were appointed to serve on this committee on bible translation for this new translation - the NIV. So that's the background behind the NIV. From the very beginning, the goal of this translation was to make it much more readable then the KJV. But keep in mind this also followed on the heels of the RSV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio(btPt7, '15:37', '17:23', document.getElementById('audioPlayer'))">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And so the goal was to not just to make it more readable, but to make a conservative as well, and to avoid the theological problems in the RSV. And so it was a theological sound translation like the NASB, but compared to the NASB, which had just come out earlier, this was a much more readable translation. And the reason is that the translators utilized dynamic equivalence far more frequently. Yes, the king James used a little bit. Yes, the NASB used a little bit. But now the NIV translators are using it much, much more than these previous translations were using dynamic equivalence. And so the readability of the translation was really the feature that drew a ton of people to it. The NIV just flew off the press. In the first printing of the NIV, they printed more bibles in the first printing for the NIV than any other bible had ever experienced - and they just flew off the shelves, they had to print more and more of them. And by the mid 1980s when the revision was done, it had become the number 1 best selling bible translation in English. This was the first time since the 1600's that the KJV was no longer the number 1 best selling translation. The KJV had reigned supreme for over 300 years. The ASV could not knock it off the pedestal, the RSV couldn't do it, the NASB couldn't do it, but finally the NIV knocked it off its pedestal in the 1980's.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '17:23', '18:53')">audio</a>
</p>


<h3 id="NIV-de">NIV - dynamic equivalence</h3>

<p class="border1">
Now let me show you some examples of dynamic equivalence in the NIV. This was the feature that drew so many people to it, that made the translations so readable. So let me show you some examples in the 1984 NIV of dynamic equivalence. And lets start with Amos chapter 4 and verse 6. But before we look at the NIV, let me show the NASB so you can get a more literal translation of the verse, and then we can compare that to the 1984 NIV. So here is the NASB from 2020.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '18:53', '19:35')">audio</a>
</p>

<table border=1><caption>Amos 4:6</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB</td><td>"But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities, And lack of bread in all your places; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NIV 84</td><td>"I gave you empty stomachs in every city and lack of bread in every town, yet you have not returned to me," declares the Lord.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
This [NASB above] is a pretty literal translation. But now let's look at the 1984 NIV [verse read]. Now what are differences here between the NASB and the 1984 NIV? Can you see the differences here - there are two of them? Yeah, cleanness of teeth which is a literal translation from the original Hebrew has been changed into a dynamic equivalent - empty stomachs - instead. And there is one other smaller change here. It has to do with the word cities being changed to towns. So instead of all your cities it says in every town. That's a very small change there, hardly noticeable, not a huge difference. The first change is the more significant one. It is a very good example of a dynamic equivalence. In fact, this verse might sound familiar to you, because I made reference to it in our very first week as a good example of a dynamic equivalence in some bible translations. Well now we can stick labels on our different translations - you're a literal translation of this can be found in the NASB - a dynamic equivalence of this can be found in the NIV. So this just shows where the translations are leaning. The NASB is leaning more toward the literal side, the NIV is leaning more toward the dynamic equivalent here. And the goal is just to make it readable, to make it understandable. The word/phrase cleanness of there could mislead people into thinking that they had good dental hygiene, but the context shows here that its just talking about not eating. And so if you're not eating then your teeth stay clean. You're not getting food on your teeth, it's not causing problems for your dental hygiene. So the NIV is saying hey lets put a dynamic equivalent here so that we don't mislead people and so we can just make the smoother and more readable. I think that was their motivation here.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '19:34', '21:30')">audio</a>
</p>
 


<p class="border1">
Let's look at another example of dynamic equivalence in the NIV. Let's look at 1 Peter 3:7 starting with the NASB [verse read]. Now this verse hopefully sounds familiar to you. We looked at this verse - only the first half of the verse - last week in the NASB and we saw that the 77 NASB got changed in the 95 NASB to be less literal. There was a word in the 95 NASB - there was a word in the 77 NASB that was very literal, and it wasn't found in the next edition. Does anyone remember what that word is here?
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '21:30', '22:18')">audio</a>
</p>

<table border=1><caption>1 Peter 3:7</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB</td><td>You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NIV 84</td><td>Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.</td></tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
Instead of someone weaker, the 77 NASB said as with a weaker something - vessel - that's right. So in the 95 NASB they changed that, trying to smooth it out a little bit and made it more readable, but they're losing that literal translation there right? Well now you can see, I didn't look at the 2020 NASB in this verse last week, but you can see here that the 2020 NASB kept it the same way as the 95 NASB - they did not increase the literalness and restore it back to the 77 NASB. We did see that in some passages last week but it's not happening here in this passage. The 77 NASB is still more literal than these newer editions of the NASB. But still the 2020 NASB is far more literal then the 1984 NIV here. Take a look at what the NIV says [verse read].
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '22:18', '23:21')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Well I'm not even going to ask you what's changed here. Basically the whole verse has changed right? There's hardly anything here that's still here. You can maybe count off major words, maybe five or six words here, major words that are still the same, but there's been a lot to word changes, there's been a lot of re-arranging of the material and I just want to point out one of the most important changes here because it doesn't have an impact on the application of this verse. Notice that the command has changed here. There's a command near the beginning of the verse. In the NASB its the word live. Live with your wives in an understanding way. But in the NIV they've kind of traded places for those two phrases there, and they've understanding parts, they changed the consider and turned that into the command - be considerate as you live with your wife. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '23:20', '24:08')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
You see how they're kind of flipping that? They're changing the verb, they're taking something that is more subordinate in the NASB and they're making that the main idea now in the NIV. And the way that this could be read now is that there is no command for a husband to live with his wife. So you know he can live with her sometimes or he can just kinda go off and do his own thing and not live with her for a while. That takes away I think the force of the command here. The command is that the husband needs to live with his wife, he can't just go off and do his own thing and do whatever he wants to do. He needs to be living with her and spending time with her. Now the main focus is on the way that he lives with her, but we can't just rush past the idea that the husband is supposed to live with his wife. And I think this has an impact on husbands and wives who have gotten separated and then just remain in that state indefinitely. This passage does not allow for that - they need to get reconciled, and just walk through the process and get reconciled. OK, there can be temporary situations, but that should not be an ongoing thing for a husband and wife. And if you're just looking at the 84 NIV here you're not gonna see that come through because it's not stating the idea very accurately from the original text here like the NASB does. So this is just one of the many changes here that the NIV is making to the original text as they translated, trying to smooth it out. They've decided to use dynamic equivalence throughout this verse and some of its not a big deal, you know the last phrase - so that you're prayers will not be hindered - so that nothing will hinder your prayers. OK, the verb is changing from a passive to active, but it's not a huge deal, the meaning is still basically the same. An important difference for careful bible study. But the earlier change that we looked at, that that is much more significant change for the meaning, and I don't think the 84 NIV, its not doing a very good job in this verse. And part of the reason its not doing a good job is its lept, gone to far away from the literal understanding of this verse. It dove too deeply into dynamic equivalence and now they're drowning in the dynamic equivalence end of the pool here. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move on, notice there are italics in the NASB. As I've mentioned the italics represent words not found in the original text, but that are implied, so they're added for clarification or smoothness. Notice that there are no italics here in the NIV, and that makes sense right, if you're not giving a literal translation why would you care about putting words in italics to show that they don't come from the original text. That's just not a focus in the NIV. So don't be surprised that there aren't any words in italics - that shouldn't surprise us at all they have chosen not to utilize that feature.

</p>


<p class="border1">
Let's move on to another example, I'll show one more example of dynamic equivalence in the 1984 NIV. 1 John 2:16. This is a pretty familiar verse right in a little section in 1 John on worldliness. Let's start with the NASB [verse read]. Now let's look at this verse in the 1984 NIV [verse read]. Now once again we have changes throughout this verse, but the changes at the beginning and the end are more minor, and I don't want to focus on those. Let's focus on the changes in the middle of the verse. There's a statement there about what worldliness is, and then there are three parts to that statement. So compare the first part to each other in the two translations - what are the changes in the NIV?
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '26:38', '27:38')">audio</a>
</p>

<table border=1><caption>1 John 2:16</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB</td><td>For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NIV 84</td><td>For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world.</td></tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
Instead of the word lust in the NASB, what do we have in the NIV? cravings - well, doesn't seem like a big deal, cravings and lust are basically synonyms right? But notice its not craving but cravings, plural.  And in the NASB its singular, so there is a little bit of a change there. The next change though in this phrase is more significant.  In the NASB we have the word flesh. What's in the NIV? sinful man. Okay, that is a possible interpretation, but i don't think it's the most likely way to interpret this phrase. I think most likely John is just talking about our body, that's what a word flesh normally refers to in scripture, its just a reference to our body, and I think the context supports that because then John goes on to talk about a specific part of our body, our eyes. And so I don't think the NIV is doing a good job with this dynamic equivalence. Yes, its a little smoother and easier to understand - but its actually probably the wrong interpretation of this phrase here. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '27:38', '28:32')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Now let's look at the second phrase in here. The NASB says the lust of the eyes. Is the NIV the same or different? It's almost the same right? There's one little change there, do you see it? His eyes, the lust of his eyes. There is no pronoun there in the original Greek. Again this might not be a correct interpretation, its talking about a person's eyes right, so it's not wrong to say that. But its not as literal as the NASB. But this pretty similar. What we can see here though is now we have the word lust here in the NIV and in the NASB. The NASB has the word lust here twice which would suggest that in the original Greek we have the same word or twice. And that is indeed the case. The NASB is reflecting that for us. The NIV is obscuring it. The NIV is basically implying "we have two different Greek words here - one that means cravings and one that means lust". That's not whats going on. It's the same Greek word twice. And you wouldn't know that from studying the NIV. You would know it from studying the NASB. Now look at the last phrase here.  
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '28:32', '29:33')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
The NASB says the boastful pride of life. And the NIV has the word boasting, so there's part of it there, but then the rest of it is completely different right. There's no word pride there, there's no word life there, instead it's expanded and kind of smoothed out - the boasting of what he has and does. That might be the right idea there, but its not a very literal translation at all. And I do think that it's actually a bit misleading. The Greek word for life there probably does refer to possessions, its used elsewhere in the new testament with that meaning. So the idea of what he has is probably correct, not the idea of what he does, that's going in the wrong direction here. So I think once again, the NIV in trying to give us a dynamic equivalence, has actually committed a misinterpretation here. So this is not a very good verse in the 1984 NIV - this verse has some problems with it, and it all gets started when you go away from a literal translation. If you're trying to interpret it and give a dynamic equivalence, well sometimes you might get it right, sometimes you might get it wrong. That is the danger that comes with that approach. So we can see that the NIV uses a lot more dynamic equivalence than the NASB.

<h3 id="NIV-fe">NIV - formal equivalence</h3>

<p class="border1">
But it is actually interesting that sometimes the NIV is just as literal as the NASB. Let me show you some examples of formal equivalence now in the 1984 NIV. We've seen dynamic equivalence, but there's actually a lot of formal equivalence in the NIV as well. Let's start with Psalm 1:1. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '30:41', '31:02')">audio</a>

<table border=1><caption>Psalm 1:1</caption>

I forgot to update the text here. So let me just read it to you from my notes and I'll have to fix my slides for the website later here. Sorry about that, I copy slides and then I replace the text and forgot to do it there. I put the right reference, but the text is wrong.

<p class="border1">
Here is Psalm 1:1 in the NASB [verse read]. That verse should sound familiar because we read it last week. And so we saw in the 2020 NASB last week - it's better than older editions of the NASB, because it's more or gender neutral in appropriate ways. Instead of saying blessed is the man, it says blessed is the person. But in the 1984 NIV it actually goes back to the word man, its using the word man. Blessed is the man who does not walk in the council of the wicked or stand the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers. And so it is pretty similar to the NASB, but there are some differences, the NIV has the word man instead of person. The NIV has the word way instead of the word path - well those are synonyms, so that's pretty close to the same. The NIV has the word mockers instead of the word scoffers, so that's pretty similar as well.

<p class="border1">
One nice thing I like about the NIV - remember how I criticized the NASB for using the word nor last week - well the NIV has the word or - that is the more natural word to use there in modern English. So other than these very minor changes, the two translations are very similar. The NIV is giving us a literal translation of this verse, they're not messing around with the wording and trying to create a dynamic equivalence in that verse.

Now let's look at an example in the new testament - hopefully I have the right verse/text here - yes. 
-->


<p class="border1">
Let's look at Luke 1:41 in the NASB [verse read]. That is another verse that we looked at last week where the 1995 NASB was not as literal as the 77 NASB. The 77 NASB had another phrase at the beginning there, it had this idea of - and it came about. So you might remember that was a phrase that was used in the 77 NASB a lot, it was deleted in the 95 NASB, and it continues to be deleted in the 2020 NASB. So the 77 NASB was more literal in this verse. Now take a look though at the NIV of 1984 [read verse]. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any changes? I don't see any changes there, it's exactly the same. The NIV has exactly the same wording as the NASB - they are equally literal in this verse here. So we don't want to get the wrong idea and think that every verse in the NIV is less literal then the corresponding verse in the NASB. That is just not the case. Many verses are equally literal, some are almost as literal, and other verses are a lot less literal - they are doing more of a dynamic equivalent. We've seen different examples of the different approaches in the 1984 NIV. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '32:49', '34:11')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Basically, it's not trying to be super readable all the way through, its increasing the readability in some passages. In others its just kind of leaving it more literal, because the translators felt - OK this is readable enough and we don't have to try to create a dynamic equivalence here. So overall, this is a much more readable translation than the NASB. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '34:10', '34:31')">audio</a>
</p>



<h3 id="NIV-complain">NIV - complaints and uproar about more changes</h3>

<p class="border1">
But it didn't take long, it was actually less than 10 years after the 84 NIV was released that people started to complain that the translation was not readable enough, it needed to increase in readability. And so the main area where the NIV was criticized had to do with gender. And I already read to you an example from Psalm 1:1 where it says blessed is the man, and even the 2020 NASB has updated that now and it says blessed is the person. Well there are many examples and 84 NIV where it was very masculine where it doesn't need to be. And so people were criticizing it for that and they said we want to make some changes. And so in 1992 the translators of the NIV start working on a new edition that was more gender inclusive. And this translation was finished in 1996. It was called the New International Version Inclusive Language Edition and it was abbreviated NIVI. The final I there stands for inclusive there and I guess they didn't bother with the L and the E there at the end to make it a really long acronym.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '34:31', '35:35')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
You probably never heard of this edition of the NIV because and that's because it was only published in the United Kingdom across the ocean there in Great Britain. But then the very next year in 1997, a magazine called World Magazine - they're still around, I checked them out yesterday to see if they are still in business and they are, a good solid Christian conservative magazine that just reports on Christian news. Well they came out with a duzy of an article in March of 1997. They reported that there were plans to make a gender neutral revision of the NIV in the United States. The World Magazine article referred to it in the title as the stealth bible. And the reason they called it the stealth bible was because the translators and the committee for the NIV, they were keeping their plans very much a secret, very hidden. They were not wanting people to know about what they were doing because they knew that people would be upset about all these different changes that they were wanting to make to the gender in the NIV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '35:34', '36:33')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
And so within 2 months there was such an uproar after this article was published that the committee in charge of translating the NIV - they released a statement saying that they were not going to make any changes to the gender language in the NIV - they weren't going to make any updates to gender related changes. It did not take long however for those translators on the committee to break their word. They came out in public and released a statement saying they weren't gonna make any gender related changes, but then two years later in a 1999, they announced that they were going to put out a new edition of the NIV in the United States that would include changes in a gender language. And this translation was called Today's New International Version (TNIV). This one you probably are familiar with, you might have heard of the TNIV. It was first published as just the new testament in 2002 and then in 2005 the whole bible was finished. And this translation met with very strong opposition throughout the United States. There were many questionable changes made to this edition of the NIV especially related to gender language.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '36:33', '37:43')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
There was a whole host of different christian leaders who criticized the translation - they were pointing out the various problems with it. And all this opposition meant that the TNIV never really caught on, it never really sold very well, they printed lots of copies of it, but they just weren't able to sell very many. And that's because most people who used the 1984 version of the NIV just kept on using the NIV, they didn't switch to the TNIV, they weren't comfortable with it, it had too many questionable changes. And so after a couple of years the translators of the TNIV, this committee that oversaw the NIV and all the editions of it, they realized their mistake here and they decided to pull the plug on the TNIV, but also to pull the plug on the 1984 NIV. And what they decided to do with replace both of these translations with a brand new revised NIV. And this one would just be called the NIV and it would replace this older 1984 NIV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '37:43', '38:42')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
This translation was published in 2011. And if you were here in our church we talked about it because we used to use the 1984 NIV in our preaching and teaching here. And when this new NIV came out we did not jump over to it. We switched to a different translation instead, the Christian standard bible which we thought was a better choice for a translation that's more readable. And that's because there were just so many problems here with the new 2011 NIV. This edition of the NIV basically end up being a lot like the TNIV, it was much more like the TNIV than it was the 1984 NIV. I basically view this change as a stunt or switcheroo where they say - you don't want to buy the TNIV well we'll force you to. We'll just rename it as the NIV and we'll get rid of the one that you like and we're not let you buy it any more. And I'm not going to say it's unethical, but it's definitely a little bit questionable what they're up to there. I'm not going to say that all the changes to the 2011 NIV were bad, and they didn't keep all the changes in the TNIV. They did make some improvements that didn't go as far as the TNIV did, but there were still many things in the 2011 NIV that were problematic. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '38:42', '39:52')">audio</a>

<h3 id="NIV-good">NIV - some good changes in the 2011</h3>

<p class="border1">
But before we look at the problems in the new NIV, let's look at some of the good changes in the 2011 NIV. Cause there were quite a few improvements to this newer edition of the NIV. Let's start in the old testament with Leviticus 19:10. Here is the 1984 NIV and then we'll compare it to the 2011 NIV. [read verse, 84 NIV]. Now look at the 2011 NIV. [read verse]. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '39:51', '40:31')">audio</a>

<tr><td>NIV 84</td><td>Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the alien. I am the Lord your God.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
There is only one word that's changed here. Can you find it? Alien has changed to a foreigner. And that makes sense right, they would make that change because how many science fiction movies and TV shows have appeared since 1984, right? So we don't want people reading the NIV and thinking - O they're talking about extraterrestrial life here. The Hebrew word there just refers to a foreigner. That what the word alien used to refer to - a foreigner, not so much anymore. So this is a good change in the NIV. It is not misleading anymore it's very accurate. That's the only change they made here from the 1984 NIV. So I do like this verse in the updated NIV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '40:31', '41:08')">audio</a>

</table>



<p class="border1">
Let's look at another example of a good change in the 2011 NIV. Luke 17:20b-21. Verse 20 is long so I only included the last part of the verse. This is Jesus is speaking here. The first part of the verse is just giving the context of what Jesus is saying here, but we don't really need it [to compare translations]. Here's what the 84 NIV says [verse read]. Now look at the change here in the 2011 NIV [verse read]. Now there are a couple of different changes here but I only want to focus on one because we're running out of time. Look at the very end of this passage, and what's the change here? It changes from "within you" to "in your midst". That's a very important change. Within you means inside of you, in your midst just means around you - close by, but not necessarily within you. And this is an improved interpretation because Jesus is talking to the unbelieving Pharisees here. Would he really say the kingdom of God is inside of them? No, because they rejected Jesus as their messiah. Its much more likely that Jesus is just simply talking about himself as the king over God's kingdom and how he is right there are among them. He's  someone who's basically prepared to set up his kingdom if they will simply submit to him and accept him as their king. But they rejected him. That's what this verse I think is talking about. And the new NIV is reflecting that more accurate interpretation here with this change. The other changes are not quite as significant here I think the updated NIV is more helpful and the other changes as well, but the change in the end there is what really is important.

<p class="border1">
Lets look at another verse in the NIV to compare the two editions here. Let's look at John 6:35 starting with the 84 NIV [verse read]. Now look at the 2011 NIV [verse read]. What's the change here in the newer NIV? It's one change that happens twice and that's it, no other changes. Yeah, its whoever instead of he who. Well that word he there doesn't really come from the original text. It's not necessary to have a masculine pronoun here. This is an example of an appropriate gender change in the NIV. There were many areas of the NIV that were too masculine. We're going to see next week that there are many places where the NIV made inappropriate changes to gender, but not all the gender changes were inappropriate. This is an example of good change I think. This is the sort of thing we saw with the NASB last week in the 2020 edition. They were making some appropriate gender changes. And the NIV made these sort of changes as well in 2011.

</table>

<p class="border1">
Let's look now at Romans chapter 3:28 starting in the 84 NIV [verse read]. Now look at the 2011 NIV [verse read]. There are two changes here. What's the first one? man to person - this is another appropriate gender change. The Greek word for man can also refer to a person of either gender. Again we saw this sort of change in a NASB last week. This is appropriate. What's the other change? It changes from observing the law to the works of the law. And the new NIV is more literal here. This is the exact phrase that we would find in the NASB if I were to put it on the screen. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '44:09', '44:57')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
The older NIV is giving us more of a dynamic equivalence here. So this is a change toward being more literal than the updated NIV and this is good, because, while I think if your understanding what that word observing means in the older NIV, you getting the right idea. Its talking about doing the work of law, right, but somebody might read that phrase and say "Well if I just read the law - OK I can't be saved by reading the law - but maybe I can be saved by doing the law. That's not what its saying.  The word observing there is referring to doing in the law, but that might mislead somebody, that's kind of an older use of the word observe there. Most people might hear the word observe and just think means to look at something. That's not what the NIV translators had in mind and so I think it probably should've been changed to doing the law instead of observing the law, just to be more clear, that would have been a better dynamic equivalence. But why not just keep it literal here? I think most people can figure out what it means when you talk about the works of the law - its talking about doing the works of the law. We don't have to spell it out ultra-clearly to people.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at another example, 1 Timothy 3:11 - here is the 1984 NIV [verse read]. In this chapter Paul was giving the qualifications for two different offices in the church. The office of elder and the office of deacon. And this verse comes right in the middle of the qualifications for deacons. So it kind of seems to come just out of nowhere here. And what the NIV 84 seems to be saying is that these are wives of deacons that Paul was talking about. But that is not the only way to interpret this verse. Look at the 2011 NIV [verse read]. Well this is almost exactly the same except the word wives is no longer there. There is another way to interpret this verse. It could be referring to female deacons, or what we would call deaconesses. And this is a very prominent translation, I think this probably has the majority of scholars on this side. And the NIV of 2011 is leaving the interpretation open here - it could be referring to wives, wives are women right, but it could be referring to other women as well, not the wives of deacons, but just women in general who would also serve along with the male deacons. These would be female deacons or deaconesses. I'm not inclined to take that interpretation, I do think its probably referring to wives, but the Greek word here can refer to just women in general or wives. And I do think it's wise of the NIV to leave it open - like a reader decide - let them think about the different options here, and decide for themselves which interpretation they think is accurate. There are plenty of good people on both sides here. So I'm definitely open to the deaconess view, I just think that the wife view is probably stronger - it's a close call.

<p class="border1">
I wish I had time to go into it but were almost out of time. Lets go into one final verse here where I want to compare these two editions of the NIV. 1 John 2:16 - this is a familiar one because we looked at it earlier. Here's the 84 NIV again [verse read]. And you'll remember that this is not a very literal translation here. In fact, there are some interpretive problems here. But now look at the 2011 NIV [verse read]. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '47:46', '48:27')">audio</a>
</p>

<table border=1><caption>1 John 2:16</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NIV 2011</td><td>For everything in the world-the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life-comes not from the Father but from the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NIV 84</td><td>For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
Well that sounds almost exactly like the NASB which I put up earlier. It's very literal there in that middle section. Now they have the word lust there twice, now they have the word flesh there, now it says pride of life at the end of that - the three phrases there instead of boasting of what he has and does. So this is a more literal translation. Its not misleading you into taking the wrong interpretation about any of these phrases. And again its just kind of letting the reader decide - what does the word flesh mean? There are different possibilities. What is the pride of life referring to? Different possibilities again. So this is another good change in the 2011 NIV. I do like the 2011 NIV in all these different verses here that we've look at, I think it improves on the 84 NIV in a variety of ways. And if these were the only changes in the 2011 NIV then I can definitely recommend it to you. But unfortunately there were many other changes in the 2011 NIV that were not so good. And so we will pick up and look at those next week. Come back next week, I'll leave you on another cliff-hanger and we will look at some other problems in the 2011 NIV. Let's close in prayer.

Thank you so much for your word Lord, and thank you that we can study a variety of different passages that are so powerful and have such good application for us today. And yet we sometimes aren't sure about the best way to handle these verses, how to translate them, how to interpret them. Thank you that we have a variety of bible translation that we can look at and compare the verses to each other and try to arrive at the best understanding of them. So I pray you'd give us wisdom as we continue to evaluate bible translations. Help us to be able to hone in on the best ones and then help us Lord to be motivated to make regular use of them so that we can grow in our knowledge of you. In Jesus name. Amen.
