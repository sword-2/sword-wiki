<h3 id="5a">review King James Version (KJV)</h3>

<p class="border1">
Well today we are continuing our study on the subject of bible translations. We started with an introduction in the first 2 weeks, and then during the past 2 weeks we have focused our attention on the KJV of the bible which is the preeminent bible translation in English. It was published all the way back in 1611 so over 400 years ago. And it was the most popular bible translation for about 300 years or so. So most of the past 400 years it has been the supreme bible translation in English. And even today, even though it is so old, it continues to be used by many believers and continues to be loved by many believers as well. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have seen that there are many problems with the KJV. So 2 weeks ago we saw that there are many passages the KJV that have obsolete or misleading language. There are many words in the KJV that just simply aren't used any more and then there are other words that are still used, but have changed in their meaning and so they are misleading. We see words like terrible and gay used in the KJV in a way that nobody would understand any more today. Those words have changed in their meaning drastically. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are also verses in the KJV that are just simply misinterpreted. For example, Jesus didn't tell his disciples to drink all the wine at the Lord's supper, he told all of them to drink some of the wine. The KJV misinterprets that statement from Jesus in the gospel Matthew. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1 Timothy 2, Paul didn't say that a woman is not to usurp authority over a man or take it by force. Instead, he was really saying that a woman is not to have authority over a man at all. So the KJV is misleading there in 1 Timothy 2. Last week we saw that the KJV is also based on inferior manuscript support, specifically in the new testament. And so what that means is that the KJV does not always reflect what is going on in the original manuscripts.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now of course, we don't have the original manuscripts anymore to look at, they've all been lost or destroyed, but we do have thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of copies. And when we compare these copies to each other we can figure out where the mistakes are. All of these copies have mistakes. Not a single one matches another one, unless maybe you got very small little fragments. But most of them are longer, they have 1 or more books of the bible and they don't agree with each other. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they all have mistakes in them and we need to identify those mistakes and correct them. And bible scholars have been very busy doing that using the minds that God has given them to recover the original text of scripture. But the new testament in the KJV is essentially based on just 7 copies in Greek. That's all it was based on, and all of those copies are dated between the 11th and the 15th centuries. So those copies aren't even very old, they're a 1000 years after the new testament was written or even more recent than that.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the new testament of the KJV actually follows a translation of the bible, the Latin Vulgate. It's not even going back to the original Greek. Its following the Latin Vulgate even when there is no support in any Greek manuscript. And last week I showed you Revelation 22:19. Revelation 22:19 in the KJV has the phrase book of life, but there is no single Greek manuscript, no copy of the new testament in Greek that has the book of Revelation, that has that verse, that has that phrase in Greek, what it would mean in Greek. Instead all of those translations have the phrase tree of life instead. And that would be the more accurate translation here into English. What's happening is the KJV is just following the Latin Vulgate. There's a mistake in the Latin Vulgate there where it has book of life instead in Latin and so the KJV is following that mistake and it gives us what is clearly wrong there.

<p class="border1">
Yeah / question. So when we were in Greek class and we had the Greek new testament, it said 5th edition. That's the 5th edition since the 1000 year old manuscript that was copied or what is it? Oh, it much more complicated than that. So yeah, the new testament that most students use is a compilation of all the evidence. So bible scholars have collected all of the thousands of manuscripts together, they've compared them to each other, and then what they try to do is synthesize all those copies into 1 Greek new testament in ancient Greek, of course. And so that new testament does not reflect any one single manuscript. Instead its trying to figure out where all the mistakes in the copies and let's restore this as close as we can do the original manuscripts, which we don't have of course, but this is as close as we think we can get. And so the 1st edition of that new testament was done I think back in the 60s. And then about every 10 or 15 years they just do a revision, cause there always more manuscripts being discovered. Every decade more manuscripts get discovered, and so that evidence gets incorporated into the study of the new testament. And so they can make little tweaks to the Greek new testament and say - oh, now we think its probably this word instead, that sort of thing. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the furthest we can go back with the Greek new testament is 1000 years? Oh no. We can go all the way back to the 2nd century, we have copies of the new testament that go back all the way to the 2nd century. So last week I mentioned that we have a very small fragment from the 18th chapter of John and it goes back to the early 2nd century, so less than probably 40 years after John wrote the gospel of John. It's not the full gospel, but its just a little portion of it. And then if you go forward another century or 2, now you start to get longer manuscripts. And in the 4th century we have 2 really long copies of the new testament. Codex Sinaiticus has the whole new testament; Codex Vaticanus has most of the new testament and they go to the 4th century. So we can go all the way back to the 4th century and we have a complete new testament, a very old copy of the new testament. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what's this thing you're talking about 1000 years ago? ah, that's the KJV, the KJV is based on only 7 copies of the new testament, and the earliest is from the 11th century. So its just not based on very old evidence. Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus - they had not been discovered yet, well Codex Vaticanus had been discovered but it was buried in the Vatican library and they weren't letting anybody look at. It was their little secret. And only in the 1800s did they finally let scholars take a look at this very important manuscript.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '04:00', '06:32')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Yeah, so the KJV is based on inferior evidence from the Greek manuscripts, its not going back to the oldest manuscripts. And so Revelation 22:19 is a good example of this. It's not based on any Greek manuscripts there with that phrase - book of life. All the Greek manuscripts say tree of life there. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are many other passages in the KJV, we looked at some of them last week. And these verses are just not based on very good evidence. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, 1 John 5:7-8 seems to have, in the KJV, a statement supporting the doctrine of the trinity. But that statement is only based on a very small number of very late Greek manuscripts. All the oldest copies of 1 John from the first 1000 years, those do not have that statement at all. So there's only a couple of very late copies of 1 John that even have that statement. And so it seems very clear that John did not write that statement about the trinity in 1 John 5. Instead, it was added later probably innocently. You know somebody's reading along there and sees these 3 witnesses on earth: the water, the spirit, and the blood - and says oh, that kind of seems like the trinity. Maybe they wrote a little devotional remark in the margin and eventually that got included in the text by accident.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the KJV is just based on inferior evidence, its not based on Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus from the 4th century. Those manuscripts are very old, they have most of the new testament, but those manuscripts were not discovered until much later, about 200 - 250 years after the king James was produced. And so they couldn't have been consulted by the translators of the KJV. But once those manuscripts were discovered, and they were studied by scholars, well then scholars could see clearly - hey, the new testament in the KJV has some serious issues here. It is significantly flawed.

<h3 id="5b">Revised Standard Version (RSV) improved readability</h3>

<p class="border1">
And so it was time for a new bible translation to be published that would incorporate all these older manuscripts that had been discovered. And so in 1855 the revised version was published. This translation was not popular in the United States at all, because it was very British, the English is very British. And so the revised version end up being tweaked a short time later so that it would be more suitable for Americans. And this translation was called the ASV. It was published in 1901. Last week, we compared the ASV to the KJV in several passages. And we could see that the ASV was better in these different passages because it was based on superior manuscript support. But what you probably noticed as we were reading these, I didn't pointed out at the time, what you probably noticed is that the ASV wasn't really that much easier to read than the KJV because it had all those same archaic pronouns that we see in the KJV. And so the ASV was eventually revised using more modern English. And this new translation was appropriately called the RSV. So not the ASV but the RSV. The new testament was published in 1946, just about 50 years or so after the ASV, and the whole bible in 1952. And so this was released not too long after the ASV, about a generation or so, but in the meantime there had been a lot of old manuscripts being discovered during that time.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the dead sea scrolls were discovered shortly before the RSV was published, and that had a lot of really old manuscripts from the old testament. And so there was a lot of new evidence that had been discovered, that goes back very old, to a very old time and the RSV was able to incorporate this new evidence and it wasn't able to be incorporated into the ASV. But the biggest improvement in the RSV was the readability of the translation. And let me show you a few passages where the RSV is more readable than the ASV. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '08:28', '10:40')">audio</a>
</p>


<table border=1><caption>Jeremiah 17:4</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>ASV</td><td>And thou, even of thyself, shalt discontinue from thy heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn for ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>RSV</td><td>You shall loosen your hand from your heritage which I gave to you, and I will make you serve your enemies in a land which you do not know, for in my anger a fire is kindled which shall burn for ever.</td></tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
Look at Jeremiah 17:4. Here is the ASV [verse read]. Now, 2 weeks ago I showed you this verse in the KJV, it may seem familiar to you. And I used it as an example very obsolete language in the KJV. And here you can see in the ASV we have that same obsolete language here. We have all of these really old archaic pronouns right? And a couple of archaic verbs there as well - shalt instead of shall. But now look at this verse in than the RSV [verse read]. So you can see here in the RSV all of those archaic pronouns in the KJV and the ASV are gone. They have just disappeared, and they've just gone off the face of the planet you can say. Instead, we all these modern pronouns - you and your and all the verbs are up to date there as well. So instead of shalt we have shall, and instead of knowest we have know. So the RSV is much, much more readable than either the king James or the ASV in this verse here.

Let's look at another passage where the RSV is more readable than the ASV. Look at Philippians 1:23-24.

<p class="border1">
The Philippians passage we looked at in the KJV, and it talks about how there is a strait betwixt, remember that phrase there in the KJV? The ASV has that same phrase, strait betwixt, but the RSV says I am hard pressed between the two. So it's using more modern English there then the king James or the ASV. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '12:29', '12:51')">audio</a>

<!-- omitted technical difficulty -->


<p class="border1">
There are many other examples I could give you where the RSV is more readable than the ASV, but those 2 will suffice there. This is a really good one here, at least I put a big long one there for you to see just how much better the RSV is in terms of readability. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '12:57', '13:09')">audio</a>

<h3 id="5c">RSV still has some archaic and misleading language</h3>

Unfortunately though, the translators of the RSV did not remove archaic language completely from the translation. They decided to continue using archaic pronouns whenever God is being addressed. Let me show you a few examples here. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '13:09', '13:25')">audio</a>
</p>



<table border=1><caption>RSV has archaic pronouns whenever God is addressed</caption>
<tr><th>References</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>Deuteronomy 3:24</td><td>O Lord GOD, thou hast only begun to show thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as thine?</td></tr>
<tr><td>Psalm 76:7</td><td>But thou, terrible art thou! Who can stand before thee when once thy anger is roused?</td></tr>
<tr><td>John 17:6</td><td>I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gavest them to me, and they have kept thy word.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
Let's start with Deuteronomy 3:24. Look at the RSV for this verse [verse read]. By the way, what's the answer to that question there? We're kind of left hanging there at the end of the verse. What god is there in heaven and on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as God's? None, right, that's the obvious answer. There doesn't really need to be an answer given its so obvious that only God is all powerful and no false [god] can do anything, right? They have no power at all. So notice that there are archaic pronouns here - thou, thy, and thine. But then there's also an archaic verb there as well, hast instead of has or have. And so this has archaic language in it, but notice its because the words are being directed toward God. Moses is speaking to God here, in a prayer you could say. So we wouldn't see these pronouns used in many other verses that aren't directed toward God, but whenever the verses are directed toward God, then we have the archaic pronouns being used. So this verse is not really any more readable in the RSV compared to the king James or the ASV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '13:25', '14:45')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Let's look at another example, Psalm 76:7 [verse read]. Once again, we're left with a question here? And what's the obvious answer that question? (Student: none). None, no one can stand before God when his anger is roused. So I think the point is verse is simply don't make God angry. Because if you make God angry you're in big trouble, there's nothing you can do to avoid having his wrath come on you. And of course that is impossible right? We are all sinners - and when we sin God is displeased and he is justified in being angry whenever people sin. As sinners, we all deserve God's judgment, we deserve to be punished in hell forever. Thankfully God is not just an angry God. Yes that's one of his attributes. But God is also merciful and he shows mercy to people who repent from their sins and put their trust in Jesus to forgive them. And then he turns his anger away from them and he shows them mercy instead. So this is just giving us 1 side of the picture, but it is an important dimension that we need to make sure that we understand and accept.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we can see right away in this verse there are archaic pronouns right up front - we have thou and then we have the word thou again and then we have thee and then we have thy. So we have several different archaic pronouns. And this is actually true throughout the book of Psalms. As you know most of the Psalms are directed toward God. The psalmist's are speaking to God. So in the RSV when you read the psalms, the archaic pronouns are just all over the place. The book is just filled with them. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this verse does not just have obsolete language. It also has misleading language. And I mentioned earlier that the KJV has this problem too. And do you remember the 2 words I mentioned, the 2 words in the KJV that are misleading? One of them is right here, do you see it? Its the word terrible. They're still using the word terrible so many 100s of years later in the RSV even though in modern English the word terrible just refers to something that's extremely bad. And so this seems to be referring to God as extremely bad. That is terribly misleading and this is a big problem. This verse is very misleading in the RSV. Its not just obsolete its misleading as well.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '14:45', '16:57')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Let me show you one more verse that has obsolete language in the RSV. Let's flip over to the new testament because we do see this in the new testament as well. Its most prevalent in the old testament like the book of Psalms, but look here in John 17:6 [verse read].
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone know who is talking here? We know who this is directed toward, it has to be directed toward God otherwise we wouldn't have the archaic pronouns. But does anybody remember who's talking to God here? Its Jesus. Yeah, John 17 records a lengthy prayer that Jesus prayed right after he was interacting with his disciples and teaching them at length. We call it the high priestly prayer of Jesus, because he's praying on behalf of his disciples, and not just his immediate disciples, but later disciples, later in the chapter as well. But here he's talking specifically about his immediate disciples, the 12 there, or specifically 11 because he knew Judas wasn't a true disciple.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the RSV does use the archaic pronouns here, these are the words of Jesus directed to his Father. And so this fits the pattern where they use these archaic pronouns where ever the verse is directed toward God. Now we might wonder - why did the translators decide to do this? Why did they decide to use the archaic pronouns when the words are directed toward God? I think the answer is just simply that they think that these archaic pronouns indicate some sort of reverence for God, probably tied back to the KJV, and the place that it had in Christianity. It was very revered and highly respected and it had all these archaic pronouns, so this probably have a holdover of that from the KJV here.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don't think that this is the best approach to take because there is nothing in the original Greek or Hebrew here to suggest that we should make a distinction when we're talking to God we have to use archaic pronouns and we don't talk to God we don't use them. There is no basis for this in the original languages of scripture. The same pronouns are used throughout the old testament in Hebrew whether they're directed toward God or not. The same pronouns are used in the Greek new testament to refer to God that are used to refer to other people. And so I do think that this approach to pronouns of the RSV is problematic. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '16:57', '19:16')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
(Student: Commented on the length of a verse being different between 2 translations.) Yeah, sometimes these older translations with the archaic language there's just more words that they need to be able to use that. In modern English we tend to simplify things more and make it compact.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '19:16', '19:47')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
So we do see in the RSV there's this problem in the translation where they're still using archaic language. It's a big improvement on the king James and the ASV, but still there are many verses here that are using words that are just not in use anymore. And this is really just the tip of the iceberg, there are many other problems with the RSV that are even more serious than this.

<h3 id="5d">RSV theological problems</h3>

</table>

<p class="border1">
Let me show you some verses where the RSV has theological problems. We'll start with Genesis 9:20. And I want to show you the ASV first, and then we'll look at the RSV and see how they've tweaked it, and how they've changed it, and how it creates a theological problem. So the ASV says [verse read]. So husbandman is kind of archaic there, but otherwise that's actually pretty up to date English right? Now let's look at this verse in the RSV [verse read]. Notice there is a pretty big difference here. The ASV says Noah began to be a husbandman, and the RSV says that Noah was the first tiller of the soil. That's a significant difference. The ASV is just saying Noah began to do something, while the RSV says Noah was the first to do something. You see the significant difference there? The ASV is actually giving us the more literal translation here. And what the RSV is doing is actually creating a contradiction with earlier verses in the book of Genesis. Let me show you 2 verses earlier in Genesis where there is a contradiction here.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '20:12', '21:25')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
(Student: The old version has a comma splice where it says and planted a vineyard - who planted a vineyard - it needs a subject there). That's probably just reflecting an older style of English. And the RSV fixes that because its more modern English.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '21:25', '21:45')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
But yeah the theology here is the really significant issue. Let's look at Genesis 3:23 [verse read].
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can anybody guess who this verse is talking about? Who did God send forth from the garden? Adam, right? Notice what it says about him. What did he do when he left the garden? He tilled the ground. And this isn't the only verse that talks about somebody is tilling the ground before Noah.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now look at Genesis 4:2 [verse read]. The she there is of course Adam's wife, Eve. Abel and Cain were there 2 oldest sons, as far as we can tell. We know they had many other sons and daughters, but these 2 were apparently the first 2. But the key here is look what the verse says about Cain, he was a tiller of the ground. So do you see that contradiction there with Genesis 9:20? Was Noah really the first tiller of the soil? Well not unless you wanna create a distinction between soil and ground, and I don't think you can. Those are basically synonyms there. So there is a contradiction here in the RSV. They have deliberately translated Genesis 9:20 to create a contradiction with these 2 earlier verses.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what this does is it reflects the low view of scripture that the translators of the RSV had. They believed that Genesis came from multiple human sources and that these sources contradicted each other. And whoever packaged the book of Genesis together either didn't notice these contradictions or didn't care about them and just threw them together. And so they would argue that this doesn't really come from God. Maybe God was involved somehow in bringing this about, but he certainly didn't over-ride the errors that we're taking place here in the human beings as they were putting this together. He let that happen. That's the viewpoint that the translators of the RSV had about scripture. They had a low view of scripture, they did not believe in the doctrine of inerrancy in scripture. So this is a very serious theological problem in the RSV and we can look at other examples. But I just wanted to show you one here were they deliberately set up a contradiction here and this reflects their poor view of scripture.

<p class="border1">
Let me show you another verse where there's a major theological problem in the RSV. Look at Isaiah 7:14, and we'll start with the ASV first [verse read]. Now look at this verse in the RSV and look to see if you can find the change [verse read]. These verses in the 2 translations are almost exactly the same but there is 1 really big change here. Do you see it? Yeah, the ASV has the word virgin, the RSV has the phrase young woman. Now it is true that the Hebrew word here does often refer to just simply a young woman. But this word is always used to refer to a young woman who is not married yet. And in Hebrew culture a woman who was not married yet, who had never been married, was almost always a virgin. And so the translators of the Greek Septuagint, when they came along and they translated the Hebrew of Isaiah 7 into Greek in the Septuagint, they chose a Greek word to translate the Hebrew word here that means virgin. And I think that was appropriate that they did that.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what's even more important here is that this verse here is quoted in the new testament. And in that quotation, the same Greek word for virgin is used that was used in the Greek Septuagint. I think the person who was quoting this was referring to the Greek Septuagint and following the wording there. Does anyone know where this verse is quoted in the new testament? What book of the new testament has a quote of Isaiah 7:14? (Student: Matthew). It's the gospel of Matthew. Can you guess which chapter? (Student: first). The first chapter right. Because we know who this is referring to right? Who is the virgin here? (Student: Mary). That's Mary. And then who is the son? (Student: Jesus). It's of course Jesus, right. Yeah, so in Matthew 1:23 we have a quote from this verse, and Matthew left no doubt in that passage that Mary was indeed a virgin. He made a point to say that when Mary became pregnant she and Joseph were not married yet. And then he went on even to say that Joseph kept Mary as a virgin until Jesus was born. So even though they got married right after Mary became pregnant, they did not have intimacy together. He kept her a virgin until she gave birth to Jesus. So Matthew is very clear that Mary was a virgin, that this was a virgin conception here. And what's interesting is that the RSV actually has an accurate translation in Matthew 1:23. Look at what it says here [verse read]. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the RSV is correct in Matthew 1:23 to have the word virgin, but what they're doing is they're implying that Matthew twisted the old testament when he quoted from it here. They're implying that he's not quoting the old testament accurate, that he's just changing the old testament to suit his purposes here. So what the RSV is basically implying is that the birth of Jesus was not really a fulfillment of old testament prophecy. It was not really fulfilling Isaiah 7:14, Matthew made that part up. So once again the RSV is presenting a low view of scripture here. And it's also giving us a low view of Jesus in the process. Because its saying here, the birth of Jesus did not fulfill the old testament.

<p class="border1">
Now let's look at another verse in the RSV that has a major theological problem. Look at Romans 9:5 starting with the ASV [verse read]. Now I know the ASV is rather difficult to follow here, were actually kind of in the middle of a sentence, and I didn't wanna go back and get the whole sentence. I really just wanna focus on the 2nd half of this verse here. And what's really going on here is this is describing Christ - of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh - and then the rest of this verse is describing Christ, at least until you get to the Amen at the end. So this verse is saying that Christ is overall, that he's God, and that he's blessed forever. Those are the 3 statements, the 3 phrases, or terms that are describing Christ there. So this verse, according to the ASV, is teaching the deity of Jesus Christ. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me show you the Christian Standard version just so you can see a more modern translation of this verse and it'll be even more clear here [verse read]. So that's very modern English there and its basically saying the same thing - Christ is God, he's overall, and he's praised for ever, a more modern way of saying blessed forever there. And forever is 1 word instead of 2 'cause that' how we spell it now in modern English there. So the CSB is taking the same approach that the ASV does here, and this is the more natural way to understand the original Greek text here.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now look at this verse in the RSV [verse read]. Do you see what's going on here? Do you see the punctuation change that took place here in the RSV? What punctuation do we have between the the words Christ and God in the first 2 translations? (Student: comma). It's a comma, right? So it is kind of continues on. What punctuation do we have in the RSV? (Student: period). There's a period. In other words there's a hard stop here, and we're going to start over with a new statement, and were changing directions. The RSV is basically saying here - okay we're talking about Christ at the beginning of the verse, now we think Paul's talking about God the Father instead. In other words, they do not take this verse to defend the deity of Christ. They're saying this verse does not teach the deity of Christ. That's what they're saying here.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that doesn't mean we can't find the deity of Christ taught anywhere in the RSV. It does teach the deity of Christ in various places, but it does seem like the translators of the RSV wanted to minimize this doctrine. They avoid teaching it as strongly as they could of, even though the original text here very much strongly supports the direction the ASV went, and the CSB, and most other modern translations go here. They agree, this verse is teaching the deity of Christ and the RSV is saying no it doesn't. You know, we're going to subtract that doctrine from this verse here. So that's a problem here.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at one more verse where there's a theological problem in the RSV. Look at 1 John 2:2 starting with the ASV [verse read]. Now look at this verse in the RSV and see if you can catch the changes that take place [verse read]. Now there are 2 changes here that have taken place moving from the ASV to the RSV. I want to talk about the one at the end of the verse first. What's happening in the end of the verse there? The RSV adds a short little phrase at the end at the end of the verse - what phrase is that? Its not the very end of the verse but just backup a couple of words. (Student: sins of). Yeah, the sins of. Notice the ASV just says for the whole world. The RSV says for the sins of the whole world. And so the RSV is adding some words there, and this is actually okay. What they're just doing is clarifying what John meant here. The context shows he's talking about sins, right? He's talking about our sins and then he's talking about the whole world. And clearly what he means is the sins of the whole world. So this is an important clarification. I appreciate that the RSV is doing this, just trying to help us understand what John was talking about.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other change here is more problematic. What's the other change? Its at the beginning of the verse there. (Student: propitiation). Yeah, propitiation has been changed to expiation. The word propitiation has to do with turning away someone's wrath. The word expiation does not have any connotation of wrath, it just refers to the removal of sin. The Greek word here underneath propitiation/expiation has been the subject of much debate in the last century or so among bible scholars. Liberal bible scholars do not like the idea that God is angry at sinners. And so they have tried to remove it from scripture wherever they can get away with it. That's why the RSV does not have the word propitiation anywhere. This is just 1 example. If we searched the ASV for the word propitiation we'd find it probably a half dozen times or so. You won't find it even once in the RSV. Wherever the ASV has propitiation, the RSV has expiation. And so the RSV is not just weakening the person of Christ and diminishing his deity, and the fact that his virgin birth fulfilled scripture, its also minimizing his work as well as diminishing the doctrine of salvation and specifically the atonement. And so it should come as no surprise that conservative bible believing Christians rejected the RSV. They criticize this translation strongly. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '30:23', '33:08')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Yeah, go ahead. (Student: So has the RSV completely eliminated the word propitiation?) Yeah, you will not find the word propitiation anywhere in the RSV. Wherever it appears in the ASV its always changed to expiation. Its not too many times, its like a half dozen times. that's important - in the new testament its mentioned 4 times i yeah, its found in Romans and in 1 John, and maybe 1 other book. So its limited in its use, but it is there several times and the RSV always changes it every time. It was a deliberate decision to steer away from this concept of the wrath of God and just remove that from those passages. And in my opinion it was a very poor choice. It was motivated by theological factors not by accuracy to the original text there.

<h3 id="5e">New American Standard Bible (NASB)</h3>

<p class="border1">
So the RSV has been rejected by bible believing Christians. They criticized it very strongly when it came out. And this action of rejecting the RSV led to the need for a new and improved revision of all the ASV. Because you know, there was a need for revision of the ASV, it was getting old and it was archaic, you know it had all this old language. They needed a new up to date version that would just take the ASV and update it. The RSV was not the way to go for conservatives. And so this action led to the launch of a new bible translation project. Can anybody guess what this translation is? American standard version; new American standard bible. They don't call it version but new American standard bible. 
	In 1959 this project was launched. And in 1960, the very next year, they finished the gospel of John, they released that. They didn't even wait to get the whole new testament done. They released the gospel of John in 1960, all 4 gospels were published in 1962. The new testament was finished in 1963, so that was about 10 or 15 years after the RSV was finished. This was clearly a reaction to the RSV. And then it took them a while to work their way through the old testament. But finally they did finish the whole bible in 1971.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '33:55', '35:14')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
And then 6 years later there was a minor revision that was done. This is very standard. Bible translations are not perfect, mistakes are made, and as readers work through it, they'll spot those mistakes, they'll submit them to the publisher, and then the translators will come back and say oh yeah, we goofed here, you know, we meant this word and we accidentally put this word there instead, or we just missed this typo here. And so after a couple of years goes by, most translations have a minor revision done. And that happened for the NASB in 1977. Thankfully this bible translation avoided those various theological problems that we saw in the RSV. There were about 40 bible scholars who worked on this translation. The vast majority of them were from the who's who of conservative bible scholars. I just glanced through the names again last night and was impressed by how many of those names I recognized. Most of those scholars who worked on that translation were prolific conservative bible scholars from that era. Those guys have all gone - they're all dead now, but for that time period they were excellent scholars.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '35:14', '36:13')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
One of those guys was actually one of my professors in seminary. His name was Robert Thomas. I think he out lived most of those guys, cause he jumped into the translation team fresh out of seminary. So I think he was only about 30 years old when he joined the translation team. He just passed away 6 years ago in 2017. He was an outstanding new testament scholar. I don't know which books he worked on, but I'm sure that he contributed to at least a couple of the new testament books. I only had him for 1 class in seminary. You know, he was winding down when I went to seminary. I think he was in his 70s, early 80s by the time I got seminary, so he wasn't able to keep up the full load that he one had. But I did have him for 1 class and I actually had him as my advisor throughout my first masters degree. So I would go meet with him every semester as I would choose my next classes, and it was a great treat to just be able to enjoy chatting with him. He was such a humble man for all the outstanding work he had done in his career - contributed to the NASB, writing many different books, and I really enjoyed getting to know him and I could just see the profound love that he had for God, for his word. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my favorite books that he wrote is actually a 2 volume commentary on the book of Revelation. He wrote that in the 1990s and to this day I don't think there's anything better on the book of Revelation. If you want to study the book of Revelation, you buy Robert Thomas' 2 volume commentary. You pay the money that you need to - it's like 60-70 bucks, but it's worth it, because it is so good. And yes there's a lot of Greek stuff in there, but you can work your way through it and still benefit from it. So Robert Thomas was an outstanding bible scholar. He was just one of many excellent conservative bible scholars who worked on the NASB. And so as a result the NASB was very sound theologically.

Let me show you how the NASB handles the passages that we just looked at, the passages that are problematic in the RSV. So let's go all the way back to Genesis 9:20. The NASB says [verse read]. And I won't read the RSV again, but just look there and you can remind yourself, oh yeah, the RSV said first tiller and that created a contradiction remember. Well the NASB doesn't have that contradiction. Its following the ASV here, it talks about how Noah began to do something. And this is the more accurate translation here.

<p class="border1">
Let's go onto Isaiah 7:14. How does the 77 edition of the NASB handle this [verse read]? That's what we were looking for right? The word virgin. That's what we want to see here, not the phrase young woman. But notice that is not the only difference between the NASB and the RSV. That's the most important difference that they have the right word their - virgin. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what else is different here when you compare the 2 translations? And I'm not looking specifically for different words here, but notice that something has happened with the capitalization. What do you see when you compare these 2 translations? Some of these words are capitalized in the NASB that are not capitalized in the RSV. Which words, see if you can spot them? (Students: himself, his) Himself and his. And what is true about both of those words? (Students: they refer to God). They both refer to God. The 1st one probably refers to God the father and the 2nd one refers to God the Son. And so what the NASB is doing here is capitalizing all pronouns that refer to God, not just in this verse, but this is a consistent practice that is true all the way through the NASB. And this is not what was going on in the RSV. They did not capitalize any pronouns that refer to God. The NASB is actually just reverting back to what was happening in the KJV. The KJV capitalized pronouns that refer to God, but when the ASV came out they did not do that, the RSV did not do that, but the translators of the NASB decide, you know what, we wanna go back and do things the way the KJV has them - let's capitalize these pronouns.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we're going to see as we continue into future weeks that this is not very common. Most bible translations of today do not capitalize pronouns that refer to God. And I do think there are good reasons not to do that. First of all there is no basis in the original Greek or Hebrew for this practice of capitalizing pronouns. If a pronoun refers to God its treated the same way as a pronoun that refers to any other person. They are not capitalized, none of those pronouns are capitalized in Greek or Hebrew. And so I don't think it really makes a lot of sense to do it in English either. Plus, I do think that in modern English most readers are gonna see these capitalized pronouns and think that they are emphatic. They're going to think - oh, we want these pronouns to really stand out at you. But again, that does not come from the original text. Instead, it's more specifically pointing you to the fact that these pronouns refer to God. And I'm not sure that most modern readers would understand that, they would get that. Maybe after reading for a while they would figure it out. But its not gonna be obvious at 1st glance - why are these pronouns capitalized? And they'll probably just think they're emphatic. But the pronouns aren't necessarily emphatic, they're just referring to God.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another problem with pronouns and capitalizing pronouns. What if you're not sure if a pronoun is referring to God or not? There are some verses where we can't be 100% certain what the pronoun is referring back to. Is it referring back to God or to something else? What if a pronoun refers to Jesus but it was spoken by people who did believe that Jesus is God? We have this in Matthew 12:38 here [verse read]. Notice that we have 2 capitalized pronounce here. The 1st one is Him. And this is what Matthew wrote. He's just reflecting his own view you could say. So its appropriate to capitalize it. Matthew certainly believed Jesus was God. But the next pronoun You, this is on the lips of the Jewish religious leaders. They did not accept the deity of Christ. They didn't even accept that he was the Messiah much less God. And so this translation here with the capitalized pronouns seems to indicate that these scribes and Pharisees believe that Jesus is God. That is very misleading. So this is just 1 of the many problems I think with capitalizing pronouns that refer to deity. And so I don't think it makes a lot of sense for bible translations to follow this practice. I think this is 1 of the minor deficiencies in the NASB.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '38:23', '42:31')">audio</a>
</p>



<p class="border1">
Yeah, question. (Student: Do you actually think its misleading us or do you think Matthew's trying to make sure that we know that he's talking about Jesus there?) Well, for one Matthew didn't capitalize the pronouns in the original Greek, this was just a choice of the translators to capitalize them in English. I think they're just trying to be consistent always capitalize any pronoun that refers to a member of the Godhead. But the problem is - you have some context where that's just not really appropriate to do that, I think. They probably should've left it not capitalized here to avoid misleading the readers into thinking that - oh, these people think that Jesus is God. I do think that that would be a legitimate conclusion to draw from the capitalized pronoun, but it's not of course what they actually believed. So I'm not a fan of capitalizing pronouns. I don't see it as a huge problem, its just more of a minor beef with the NASB.

Let's look now at Romans 9:5 in the NASB [verse read]. Remember the RSV creates that strong break between Christ and God. The NASB does not do that, it follows the ASV, and puts this is all together, Christ is being referred to here as God. So the NASB is supporting the deity of Christ in this verse as it should.

<p class="border1">
Let's now look at 1 John 2:2, the last one that we look at, where we were criticizing the RSV. Here's what the NASB says in this verse [verse read]. Now earlier we saw the RSV has the word expiation here, but the NASB thankfully does not. It sticks with the word propitiation just like we saw with the ASV. So the NASB is upholding a biblical view here of the work of Christ, the atonement here, its communicating an accurate understanding of the doctrine of salvation in this verse. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the translators of the NASB did make a helpful change here compared to the ASV. Let me put the ASV back up so that you can see it. And look at the end of this verse. Do you see where the NASB has added some words here compared to the ASV? What words have been added in the NASB that are not included in the ASV? (Student: those of). Those of. The ASV just says for the whole world. The NASB says for those of the whole world. And that's very similar to what we saw in the RSV. The RSV added that phrase - the sins of. And the NASB is doing something very similar, it doesn't put the word sins there, it just says those. But the word those clearly refers back to sins earlier in the verse. And so the NASB translators are doing the same thing the RSV translators did, just doing it a little bit differently. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that there is a change in the font here as well. What's the change here? (Student: those of in italics). We have the phrase those of in italics. That was done by the translators, I didn't do that, I'm just preserving what they gave us in the translation. What they're doing is they're using italics to show us that we've added some words here that don't come directly from the original text here. And if you remember, we talked about this 2 weeks ago with the KJV. The KJV did this as well, they would put words or phrases in italics that they're adding for clarification, to sort of smooth out the verse and make it more understandable, and they don't come directly from the text but they're implied from the original text. The NASB is doing the same thing here. The RSV did not follow that practice. The ASV did and the NASB is just continuing with that practice here.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am not a huge fan of this either. I understand totally why the RSV translators decide not to put any italics in their translation. When you see a italics, when you're reading something, and you see italics, what are you inclined to think? What does italics do to the words? (Student: emphasis). Emphasis. Yeah you put words in italics that you want to stand out, that you want to emphasize. That's very standard practice in modern English today. Pick up any book and look for italics and you'll immediately see - oh yeah, the author is clearly trying to emphasize this word or this phrase. That is the opposite of what the translators of the NASB are trying to do. They're trying to minimize the words and say hey, these didn't come from the original text, we're just adding these.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the implication for those who don't understand what's going on, seems to be the opposite, oh these are emphatic words. Well you'd have to read the preface to the NASB to see what they intended by this. And most bible readers aren't reading the prefaces to their bible, they just jump right in and they start reading. And so these italics are going to mislead them, they're not going to understand the point of the italics in the NASB.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am not a fan of the italics in the NASB. I do like the idea of indicating when you've added words that are only implied but they don't come directly from the original text, especially when we're doing a more literal translation. And the NASB is a very literal translation. We'll circle back to that next week and I'll tell you just how literal it is. It is pretty literal. And so I do like to like the idea of doing something here, but not italics. That is the wrong way to go. There's a better way to do this in modern English, and I would suggest brackets are the way to go. Just put brackets around that phrase, because brackets are used in quotations to add words that were not in the original. Well, that's basically what they're doing, they're adding words that didn't really come from the original. So just put it in brackets instead of the italics, and I think most people will get the idea without having to read the preface to your translation.

<h3 id="5f">NASB 77 minor weaknesses - italics, capitalization, archaic pronouns</h3>

<p class="border1">
So we've see that the NASB is very sound theologically, it doesn't have any of these problems that we saw in the RSV when it comes to theology. But there are some minor weaknesses in the NASB. These italics that we've seen, those capitalized pronouns, I think those are some minor weaknesses in the NASB. And there is another weakness I want to point out as well. And this weakness was something we already saw in the RSV earlier. You probably noticed as we've been reading these verses in the NASB that there haven't been any archaic pronouns. Have you noticed that? All the pronouns are modern English pronouns. But we haven't looked at enough verses. Some of the verses in the NASB do have archaic pronouns. That's because the translators of the NASB followed the same approach as the RSV, they capitalized pronouns that refer to God. So let's walk through those verses we looked at earlier in the NASB now. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '48:01', '48:56')">audio</a>
</p>



<table border=1><caption>NASB 77 has some archaic pronouns whenever God is being addressed</caption>

</table>

<p class="border1">
Let's look at Deuteronomy 3:24 [verse read]. And so here we have a whole bunch of archaic words right? We have Thou, we have hast, a verb, an old verb, we have thy, and at the very end we have thine. All of these words are no longer used in modern English. And yet we have them because the words are directed toward God. That's what the translators of the NASB wanted to do, they want to use this archaic language whenever the words refer to God. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's look at Ps 76:7 [verse read]. So here's a bunch of archaic words again - thou, art, thy, and thou again at the end, and art. Now the RSV had another problem here that we saw as well, remember it had the word terrible here. Thankfully, the NASB fixes that and puts that in more modern English- it just says art to be feared. I just wish that they would've said - you are to be feared, instead of thou art to be feared. Let's put this in modern English so it's more understandable. So it's an improvement on the RSV, but not much.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let's look at John 17:6 [verse read]. So this verse in the NASB has all those same archaic words we saw in the RSV for this verse earlier. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt5, '48:56', '50:34')">audio</a>
</p>




<p class="border1">
In both the old and new testament the NASB has plenty of verses, in the 1977 edition, that are just not very readable because of this very obsolete language. The NASB is already a difficult translation to read because it's so literal. The more literal a translation is the harder it is to read. But then you throw in all these archaic words as well and it becomes very difficult to read. The NASB is a challenging translation to read in the 1977 edition. But thankfully that's not the end of the story for the NASB. The NASB did not fade into oblivion at this point like the ASV did. The publisher of the NASB listened to this feedback that was coming from people as they were reading it and saying - I don't like this, I don't like that. And the publisher decided to do something about the archaic language in the translation. But we are just about out of time, and so I'm afraid I'm going to have to end on a cliffhanger. Come back next week and we will resume with the NASB and see what the publisher decided to do with it.

Let's close in prayer. Thank you Lord so much for your word. Thank you for all these of scripture passages we've been able to look at today, we've seen the problems in these verses in several translations, but we've also been able to see some of the amazing truths that are here as well and we've reflected on some of those. So I thank you Lord for your word, and thank that as we study it at look at it carefully, that we can find such rich application for our lives. But Lord, I pray you'd give us wisdom as we evaluate these different translations, we compare them to each other. Help us to understand these differences and to be able to evaluate them properly and to be able to hone in on which translations are doing the best job in these passages, so that when we read your word, we can be confident that we are getting the best understanding of your truth. We pray this in Jesus name. Amen.
