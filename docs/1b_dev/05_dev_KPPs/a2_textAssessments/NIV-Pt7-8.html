<title>bible Translations part 7 and 8, 2023-07Jul-16, 23</title>


<h3 id="review1">Review 1</h3>

<b>King James Version (KJV):</b>
<p class="border1">
Well we're now in the middle of our study of bible translations approaching at the half way point. We are now in our 7th week. So far though we've only covered one bible translation that I can recommend to you. We started with the KJV, at least that was the first major translation that we looked at in English. And I was not able to recommend that one because of all the obsolete language in it, and because it is also based on inferior manuscript support in the new testament. So even though it remains a popular translation today, I don't think it is quite good enough for regular use today - there are much better choices available.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '00:00', '00:36')">audio</a>
</p>

<b>American Standard Version (ASV):</b>
<p class="border1">
Then we looked at the ASV which is better than the KJV - its based on better manuscript support - but the problem with the ASV is it was just as hard to read as the KJV. It continued to have a lot of obsolete language. And so I can't recommend the ASV either.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '00:36', '00:53')">audio</a>
</p>

<b>Revised Standard Version (RSV):</b>
<p class="border1">
Then we looked at the RSV which was published in 1952. And thankfully that translation was a lot more readable than either the KJV or the ASV, but it did still have some obsolete language. There were some archaic pronouns that were used in reference to God. That's not a huge issue cause that doesn't cover most of the bible. The big problem with the RSV was theological. It had a lot of theological problems and bible believing conservative Christians rightly criticized that translation and decided "we're not going to use this". So I can't recommend the RSV to you either. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '00:53', '01:29')">audio</a>
</p>

<b>New American Standard Version (NASB):</b>

<p class="border1">
Thankfully the next major bible translation that we looked at avoided those theological problems in the RSV. We're talking about the NASB which we've looked at over the last 2 weeks. This translation was published in 1971 and then was revised in 1977. Now those 2 editions did have some obsolete language - they had archaic pronouns referring to God, but then there was a new edition of the NASB that was released in 1995 and all those archaic pronouns were thankfully removed. And so this translation became a lot more readable in 1995. Then just a few years ago there was another revision in 2020, and this is the current edition now of the NASB. So whenever I refer to the NASB, and I put it up on the screen, unless I put a year with it, I am referring to the 2020 NASB, the most current edition of the NASB. And last week we compared the 2020 NASB to the previous edition, the one that I grew up using, the 1995 NASB. And we looked at 11 different passages, and in all of those passages I thought the NASB was better in the 2020 edition. They made some significant improvements. So for example we saw last week that the 2020 NASB is more gender sensitive. The 95 NASB and the previous editions had a lot of masculine language that just wasn't really based on the original text. And so the translators I think wisely updated the 2020 NASB to not be just so masculine heavy. So for example they changed the word brethren to the phrase brothers and sisters. They would often change the word man to the word person if the context allowed for that. Sometimes they would change the word he to the word one. So instead of saying he who does this they would save the one who does this. So that's more gender sensitive. And all of those changes I think we're allowed in the original text, there was nothing masculine in the original text that dictated the way it had been previously translated. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '01:29', '03:29')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
There were many other good changes in the 2020 NASB that we saw. Many of them resulted in smoother and more readable English, so we saw a place in the Psalms where the NASB had the phrase "be not envious" in the 95 edition. And thankfully the 2020 NASB has a smoother way of saying that - do not be envious. The NASB has the phrase "this you know" in the book of James. It sounds like Yoda from star wars is talking to us. "Or did this you know" - sounds like something he [Yoda] would say. But that's not normal English. Instead we would say "you know this" - subject, verb, direct object and that's what the 2020 NASB has.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '03:29', '04:06')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Many places in the NASB used to have the word shall, which is kind of an old archaic word that we don't use so much anymore. And the NASB in 2020 starts to shift away from that word and changed many of those shalls to wills instead. We say the word will instead of the word shall these days. Some changes in the 2020 NASB just result in better interpretation of scripture, so for example in Matthew chapter 19, we saw Jesus talking about an exception for a husband and a wife getting divorced. Divorce is not normally allowed, but under certain situations divorce is allowed, and the older NASB editions starting in the 70s and up to the 90s, they talked about how Jesus was permitting divorce for simply immorality. Well, immorality is too general of a word - that can refer to wickedness the general. The Greek word there was referring to sexual immorality, and so the 2020 NASB ads that word sexual there to make that more clear, so its not misleading people into thinking Oh I can just get a divorce because my spouse is wicked - no that's not allowed. It has to be specific types of wickedness.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '04:06', '05:11')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
In 1 Corinthians chapter 7, the 95 NASB and the older editions refer to a man's virgin daughter. The word daughter is in italics there to show that its an interpretation, its added, its not part of the original text. But it's not a very good interpretation. Paul was probably talking about a man who was engaged to a virgin instead. And so 2020 NASB just deletes that word daughter, it takes it out and leaves it more open. It could refer to a daughter, it could refer to a fiancee instead. Most scholars think it refers to a man's fiancee, a woman he's engaged to, a virgin woman, and that's more likely I think, so this is a good change. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '05:11', '05:47')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
We also looked at a verse in 1 John chapter 3 where the older NASB seems to indicate that if you are sinning at all then you are not born of God. And that's kind of troubling because in chapter 1 John said that if you claim to be without sin you are deceiving yourself. O, so can no one be saved then? No, chapter 3 is not referring to sinning at all, it's referring to the practice of sin, habitual sin, continual sin. And so the 2020 NASB makes a little change there and puts the word continually in italics to help us understand what is John really talking about here. That's the proper interpretation I think. If you don't put a word like that there it can definately confuse and mislead people. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '05:47', '06:28')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Now I'm not saying I love everything about the NASB - I'm sure I can find some verses in the 2020 NASB that I'm not a huge fan of. It was hard to find them last week when I was researching - I do like most of the changes. There are some features of the NASB I'm not a huge fan of, and these are things that have been part of the NASB from the beginning. They capitalize pronouns that refer to God. They put words in italics that aren't based directly on the original text. Well the problem with that is italics usually convey emphasis in modern English. That's not the meaning of the italics though in the NASB, so that's a little bit misleading. We saw last week that the NASB uses all caps for old testament quotations. And so whenever the old testament is being quoted, if somebody is reading that, they're going to think that they're being shouted at. And that's not the idea there. That not what the NASB translators are trying to communicate. So I don't mind them emphasizing old testament quotes, I don't mind them putting words in brackets or doing something to words that come from the original text, but why italics, and why use all caps? Those don't seem like very smart decisions to me. Hopefully in a future edition they will make a change and decide you know we shouldn't use italics - we shouldn't use all caps - let's find some other way of doing what we wanna do here. But you know these flaws are minor, and they don't keep me for recommending the NASB. I think this is one of the best English translations available today - definitely something that you want to have available to consult as you study God's word. And one of the best features of the NASB is it's pretty literal. That makes it very valuable for careful bible study - when your really wanting to dig into the individual words in the bible, the NASB is a translation that will really help you a lot.

<b>Numbers to compare translations:</b>

<p class="border1">
Now when we started our study on bible translations, I told you that I would be putting all the translations that I cover on a spectrum between 1 and 100 with 1 representing perfect formal equivalence and 100 representing perfect dynamic equivalence. So what that just means is the lower the number is, the more literal the translation is. So you might remember me talking about this a few weeks ago, but I haven't really delivered on my promise yet have I? I haven't assigned any numbers to any bible translations. So it is now time for me to start delivering on my promise. Here are the numbers that I would assign to the translations we've covered so far. And lets work our way backwards, lets start with the NASB and work our way back to the KJV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '08:05', '08:52')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1"> 
I would put the NASB at the number 17. So between 1 and 100 I would put it at the number 17. And you might think that's a kind of random number - well this past week I went through, and looked at all the translations I'm going to be covering in this class, I'll assign them all different numbers. Cause I told you I don't need to assign the same number to any two translations. So that means we're just gonna have to sort of some oddball numbers in there, they're not going to be round numbers or anything like that. So the NASB ends up at a 17 - I actually started a little lower than that, then I decided to move it up. This is the 2020 NASB. Older editions of the NASB might be a little bit lower than that, like the 1977 edition, but that's not available anymore, except on line I guess, you can find it online. That's not in print - this is the current NASB. So I would put it at a the 17. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that may seem sort of high, didn't I just say it's a pretty literal translation? Well, yes, but remember that even the most literal bible translations still incorporate some dynamic equivalence. And so I'm not going to give any translation a number below 10. Ten will be the lowest number that I assign to any translation, because even those most literal translation are going to use some amount of dynamic equivalence. Now notice that I also put a reading level here. This comes out at about a 10th grade reading level. So I just want you see, not only how the literal is it, but how easy is it to read as well. And usually the lower the number is on this 1 to 100 spectrum, the higher the grade level will be. In general, there will be some exceptions to that, but usually the more literal a translation is the harder it is to read. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now some bible scholars, and you can find this still today if you search for this, Christian book does this and several other websites - they assign 11th grade reading level to the NASB. And as I've look at it carefully, I don't agree with that, I think that probably was assigned to the NASB way back in the 70s when it was first released. And it was harder to read back in the 70s with all those archaic pronouns. It is become easier to read and so I'm comfortable moving it up to 10th grade. I think it is easier to read then it once was. And I'll be putting several other translations at the 10th grade level as well, some of our more liberal bible translations. I think especially in the 2020 edition, it's become as easy to read as it ever has been. It's still not the easiest translation to read, but it's easier then it used to be.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '08:52', '11:13')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Now we also covered the RSV. And I would put that translation at the number 22. So in other words, it is not quite as literal as the NASB, but it is still definitely on the more literal side of the spectrum here. Notice that I put this translation at an 11th grade reading level, which is a little weird. Why is it less literal but harder to read?  Remember those archaic pronouns in the RSV? That's what kind of drags down the readability of this translation. There's also some other obsolete language in it as well. It is after all 70 years old now, so it's not super readable for modern people today. So I would assign that an 11th grade reading level.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '11:13', '11:55')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Yeah - question. What's the reading level for a KJV? We'll get to that - it's gonna be higher.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '11:55', '12:01')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Now let's talk about the ASV. Most bible scholars say that the ASV is actually the most literal bible translation that's ever been published. And I used to say that as well, but after looking at things a little more carefully this past week, I would not go quite that far. I would say that it's very literal and one of the most literal translations, but I do think there's at lease 1 translation that's more literal than the ASV, and we'll actually be covering up one later in the class. But I would say the ASV is more literal than the NASB, the current edition at least, so I would put it at a little lower number then the 17 - I would drop this down to 12. I'll have one translation that I'll put at a 10, and this one is in second place right behind that one. This one comes out at a 12. And this is a very hard translation to read, even harder than the RSV, its just full of archaic pronouns and just an older translation. So this comes out at a 12th grade reading level.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '12:04', '12:58')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Finally, lets talk about the KJV. I would put the KJV at the number 15. And I've gone back and forth on this one. Is it more literal than the NASB or less literal? Different people say different things, but I looked at enough passages and compared them where I'm comfortable dropping the KJV a little bit lower then the current edition of the NASB. It's just a tiny bit more literal. And I'll actually put another translation right in between them. So there's going to be a couple translations are very similar in terms of how literal they are - with just some very small differences. But it is not as literal as the ASV. The ASV took it up a notch in terms of literalness. The KJV I would probably mark it even higher, but I think 12th grade is the highest reading level that gets assigned to any translations. So even though it's harder to read than the ASV, I'll just let them share the 12th grade reading level here. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '12:58', '13:48')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Alright, we're now ready to move on to our next bible translation. I've caught you up on these numbers I promised to give you, I've given reading levels for these translations, and we'll continue to do this with the new translations that we cover as well. And so by the end will cover something like 15 translations and I'll have a number on the spectrum for you for each one and then the reading level for each one, and that will help you to decide which translations you might want to check into, and which ones you might use. Just some of the features that helps us to compare translations to each other. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '13:48', '14:18')">audio</a>
</p>


<h3 id="NIV-intro">New International Version (NIV) - introduction </h3>

<p class="border1">
So let's look at our next bible translation. This next translation followed closely on the heels of the NASB. The NASB was published in 1971. And this next translation was published just a few years later. It's called the New International Version (NIV). It was first published in 1973 with just the new testament and then in 1978 the whole bible was finished. So that was just seven years after the NASB. There was a minor revision that was done in 1984. That's very similar to what we saw with the NASB - that got revised in 1977. And then I just kept referring to the 77 edition. I'll do that with the NIV as well, I'll just refer to the 84 edition because the 78 edition didn't get used for very long. The 84 edition was the one that really rose in prominence and was used widely. Now actually the NIV was originally conceived all the way back in 1955. There was a business man named Howard Long who would travel around and share the gospel with fellow business people, and he became frustrated that he was having to use the KJV to share the gospel with people. I think he knew better than to use the RSV, and he didn't want to use the ASV, because that was not any more readable than the KJV. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '14:18', '15:38')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So there just weren't really any good options back in the 50s. He had to use the KJV and he was struggling with all the archaic language in it, trying to help people to understand this. And so Howard Long petitioned his denomination, I think it was the christian reformed church, that denomination that he was part of, and he first talked to his pastor at his local church, and eventually they petitioned the denomination that they were part of, to look into the possibility of developing a brand new bible translation in contemporary English. In other words, making it much, much more readable than the KJV. And after several denials from first the denomination, and then the larger Christian world, eventually a decision was reached to move forward with a new bible translation. That happened 10 years later in 1965. There were a couple different groups who came together including the denomination that Howard Long was part of, and then another group of evangelicals, and they agreed - OK lets work together and lets partner together to make a new bible translation. And in 1967 these groups established a committee to begin working on the new translation. They found 15 bible scholars who were very conservative, but they were part of different denominations. They came from different backgrounds, but they all believed in the authority of scripture, they had a high view of God. So they were solid conservatives scholars, and these 15 scholars were appointed to serve on this committee on bible translation for this new translation - the NIV. So that's the background behind the NIV. From the very beginning, the goal of this translation was to make it much more readable then the KJV. But keep in mind this also followed on the heels of the RSV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio(btPt7, '15:37', '17:23', document.getElementById('audioPlayer'))">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And so the goal was to not just to make it more readable, but to make a conservative as well, and to avoid the theological problems in the RSV. And so it was a theological sound translation like the NASB, but compared to the NASB, which had just come out earlier, this was a much more readable translation. And the reason is that the translators utilized dynamic equivalence far more frequently. Yes, the king James used a little bit. Yes, the NASB used a little bit. But now the NIV translators are using it much, much more than these previous translations were using dynamic equivalence. And so the readability of the translation was really the feature that drew a ton of people to it. The NIV just flew off the press. In the first printing of the NIV, they printed more bibles in the first printing for the NIV than any other bible had ever experienced - and they just flew off the shelves, they had to print more and more of them. And by the mid 1980s when the revision was done, it had become the number 1 best selling bible translation in English. This was the first time since the 1600's that the KJV was no longer the number 1 best selling translation. The KJV had reigned supreme for over 300 years. The ASV could not knock it off the pedestal, the RSV couldn't do it, the NASB couldn't do it, but finally the NIV knocked it off its pedestal in the 1980's.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '17:23', '18:53')">audio</a>
</p>


<h3 id="NIV-de">NIV - dynamic equivalence</h3>

<p class="border1">
Now let me show you some examples of dynamic equivalence in the NIV. This was the feature that drew so many people to it, that made the translations so readable. So let me show you some examples in the 1984 NIV of dynamic equivalence. And lets start with Amos chapter 4 and verse 6. But before we look at the NIV, let me show the NASB so you can get a more literal translation of the verse, and then we can compare that to the 1984 NIV. So here is the NASB from 2020.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '18:53', '19:35')">audio</a>
</p>

<table border=1><caption>Amos 4:6</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB</td><td>"But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities, And lack of bread in all your places; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NIV 84</td><td>"I gave you empty stomachs in every city and lack of bread in every town, yet you have not returned to me," declares the Lord.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
This [NASB above] is a pretty literal translation. But now let's look at the 1984 NIV [verse read]. Now what are differences here between the NASB and the 1984 NIV? Can you see the differences here - there are two of them? Yeah, cleanness of teeth which is a literal translation from the original Hebrew has been changed into a dynamic equivalent - empty stomachs - instead. And there is one other smaller change here. It has to do with the word cities being changed to towns. So instead of all your cities it says in every town. That's a very small change there, hardly noticeable, not a huge difference. The first change is the more significant one. It is a very good example of a dynamic equivalence. In fact, this verse might sound familiar to you, because I made reference to it in our very first week as a good example of a dynamic equivalence in some bible translations. Well now we can stick labels on our different translations - you're a literal translation of this can be found in the NASB - a dynamic equivalence of this can be found in the NIV. So this just shows where the translations are leaning. The NASB is leaning more toward the literal side, the NIV is leaning more toward the dynamic equivalent here. And the goal is just to make it readable, to make it understandable. The word/phrase cleanness of there could mislead people into thinking that they had good dental hygiene, but the context shows here that its just talking about not eating. And so if you're not eating then your teeth stay clean. You're not getting food on your teeth, it's not causing problems for your dental hygiene. So the NIV is saying hey lets put a dynamic equivalent here so that we don't mislead people and so we can just make the smoother and more readable. I think that was their motivation here.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '19:34', '21:30')">audio</a>
</p>
 


<p class="border1">
Let's look at another example of dynamic equivalence in the NIV. Let's look at 1 Peter 3:7 starting with the NASB [verse read]. Now this verse hopefully sounds familiar to you. We looked at this verse - only the first half of the verse - last week in the NASB and we saw that the 77 NASB got changed in the 95 NASB to be less literal. There was a word in the 95 NASB - there was a word in the 77 NASB that was very literal, and it wasn't found in the next edition. Does anyone remember what that word is here?
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '21:30', '22:18')">audio</a>
</p>

<table border=1><caption>1 Peter 3:7</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB</td><td>You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NIV 84</td><td>Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.</td></tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
Instead of someone weaker, the 77 NASB said as with a weaker something - vessel - that's right. So in the 95 NASB they changed that, trying to smooth it out a little bit and made it more readable, but they're losing that literal translation there right? Well now you can see, I didn't look at the 2020 NASB in this verse last week, but you can see here that the 2020 NASB kept it the same way as the 95 NASB - they did not increase the literalness and restore it back to the 77 NASB. We did see that in some passages last week but it's not happening here in this passage. The 77 NASB is still more literal than these newer editions of the NASB. But still the 2020 NASB is far more literal then the 1984 NIV here. Take a look at what the NIV says [verse read].
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '22:18', '23:21')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Well I'm not even going to ask you what's changed here. Basically the whole verse has changed right? There's hardly anything here that's still here. You can maybe count off major words, maybe five or six words here, major words that are still the same, but there's been a lot to word changes, there's been a lot of re-arranging of the material and I just want to point out one of the most important changes here because it doesn't have an impact on the application of this verse. Notice that the command has changed here. There's a command near the beginning of the verse. In the NASB its the word live. Live with your wives in an understanding way. But in the NIV they've kind of traded places for those two phrases there, and they've understanding parts, they changed the consider and turned that into the command - be considerate as you live with your wife. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '23:20', '24:08')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
You see how they're kind of flipping that? They're changing the verb, they're taking something that is more subordinate in the NASB and they're making that the main idea now in the NIV. And the way that this could be read now is that there is no command for a husband to live with his wife. So you know he can live with her sometimes or he can just kinda go off and do his own thing and not live with her for a while. That takes away I think the force of the command here. The command is that the husband needs to live with his wife, he can't just go off and do his own thing and do whatever he wants to do. He needs to be living with her and spending time with her. Now the main focus is on the way that he lives with her, but we can't just rush past the idea that the husband is supposed to live with his wife. And I think this has an impact on husbands and wives who have gotten separated and then just remain in that state indefinitely. This passage does not allow for that - they need to get reconciled, and just walk through the process and get reconciled. OK, there can be temporary situations, but that should not be an ongoing thing for a husband and wife. And if you're just looking at the 84 NIV here you're not gonna see that come through because it's not stating the idea very accurately from the original text here like the NASB does. So this is just one of the many changes here that the NIV is making to the original text as they translated, trying to smooth it out. They've decided to use dynamic equivalence throughout this verse and some of its not a big deal, you know the last phrase - so that you're prayers will not be hindered - so that nothing will hinder your prayers. OK, the verb is changing from a passive to active, but it's not a huge deal, the meaning is still basically the same. An important difference for careful bible study. But the earlier change that we looked at, that that is much more significant change for the meaning, and I don't think the 84 NIV, its not doing a very good job in this verse. And part of the reason its not doing a good job is its lept, gone to far away from the literal understanding of this verse. It dove too deeply into dynamic equivalence and now they're drowning in the dynamic equivalence end of the pool here. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move on, notice there are italics in the NASB. As I've mentioned the italics represent words not found in the original text, but that are implied, so they're added for clarification or smoothness. Notice that there are no italics here in the NIV, and that makes sense right, if you're not giving a literal translation why would you care about putting words in italics to show that they don't come from the original text. That's just not a focus in the NIV. So don't be surprised that there aren't any words in italics - that shouldn't surprise us at all they have chosen not to utilize that feature.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '24:08', '26:38')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Let's move on to another example, I'll show one more example of dynamic equivalence in the 1984 NIV. 1 John 2:16. This is a pretty familiar verse right in a little section in 1 John on worldliness. Let's start with the NASB [verse read]. Now let's look at this verse in the 1984 NIV [verse read]. Now once again we have changes throughout this verse, but the changes at the beginning and the end are more minor, and I don't want to focus on those. Let's focus on the changes in the middle of the verse. There's a statement there about what worldliness is, and then there are three parts to that statement. So compare the first part to each other in the two translations - what are the changes in the NIV?
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '26:38', '27:38')">audio</a>
</p>

<table border=1><caption>1 John 2:16</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NASB</td><td>For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NIV 84</td><td>For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world.</td></tr>
</table>


<p class="border1">
Instead of the word lust in the NASB, what do we have in the NIV? cravings - well, doesn't seem like a big deal, cravings and lust are basically synonyms right? But notice its not craving but cravings, plural.  And in the NASB its singular, so there is a little bit of a change there. The next change though in this phrase is more significant.  In the NASB we have the word flesh. What's in the NIV? sinful man. Okay, that is a possible interpretation, but i don't think it's the most likely way to interpret this phrase. I think most likely John is just talking about our body, that's what a word flesh normally refers to in scripture, its just a reference to our body, and I think the context supports that because then John goes on to talk about a specific part of our body, our eyes. And so I don't think the NIV is doing a good job with this dynamic equivalence. Yes, its a little smoother and easier to understand - but its actually probably the wrong interpretation of this phrase here. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '27:38', '28:32')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Now let's look at the second phrase in here. The NASB says the lust of the eyes. Is the NIV the same or different? It's almost the same right? There's one little change there, do you see it? His eyes, the lust of his eyes. There is no pronoun there in the original Greek. Again this might not be a correct interpretation, its talking about a person's eyes right, so it's not wrong to say that. But its not as literal as the NASB. But this pretty similar. What we can see here though is now we have the word lust here in the NIV and in the NASB. The NASB has the word lust here twice which would suggest that in the original Greek we have the same word or twice. And that is indeed the case. The NASB is reflecting that for us. The NIV is obscuring it. The NIV is basically implying "we have two different Greek words here - one that means cravings and one that means lust". That's not whats going on. It's the same Greek word twice. And you wouldn't know that from studying the NIV. You would know it from studying the NASB. Now look at the last phrase here.  
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '28:32', '29:33')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
The NASB says the boastful pride of life. And the NIV has the word boasting, so there's part of it there, but then the rest of it is completely different right. There's no word pride there, there's no word life there, instead it's expanded and kind of smoothed out - the boasting of what he has and does. That might be the right idea there, but its not a very literal translation at all. And I do think that it's actually a bit misleading. The Greek word for life there probably does refer to possessions, its used elsewhere in the new testament with that meaning. So the idea of what he has is probably correct, not the idea of what he does, that's going in the wrong direction here. So I think once again, the NIV in trying to give us a dynamic equivalence, has actually committed a misinterpretation here. So this is not a very good verse in the 1984 NIV - this verse has some problems with it, and it all gets started when you go away from a literal translation. If you're trying to interpret it and give a dynamic equivalence, well sometimes you might get it right, sometimes you might get it wrong. That is the danger that comes with that approach. So we can see that the NIV uses a lot more dynamic equivalence than the NASB.

<h3 id="NIV-fe">NIV - formal equivalence</h3>

<p class="border1">
But it is actually interesting that sometimes the NIV is just as literal as the NASB. Let me show you some examples of formal equivalence now in the 1984 NIV. We've seen dynamic equivalence, but there's actually a lot of formal equivalence in the NIV as well. Let's start with Psalm 1:1. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '30:41', '31:02')">audio</a>

<p class="border1">
Here is Psalm 1:1 in the NASB [verse read]. That verse should sound familiar because we read it last week. And so we saw in the 2020 NASB last week - it's better than older editions of the NASB, because it's more or gender neutral in appropriate ways. Instead of saying blessed is the man, it says blessed is the person. But in the 1984 NIV it actually goes back to the word man, its using the word man. Blessed is the man who does not walk in the council of the wicked or stand the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers. And so it is pretty similar to the NASB, but there are some differences, the NIV has the word man instead of person. The NIV has the word way instead of the word path - well those are synonyms, so that's pretty close to the same. The NIV has the word mockers instead of the word scoffers, so that's pretty similar as well.

<p class="border1">
One nice thing I like about the NIV - remember how I criticized the NASB for using the word nor last week - well the NIV has the word or - that is the more natural word to use there in modern English. So other than these very minor changes, the two translations are very similar. The NIV is giving us a literal translation of this verse, they're not messing around with the wording and trying to create a dynamic equivalence in that verse.

Now let's look at an example in the new testament - hopefully I have the right verse/text here - yes. 
-->


<p class="border1">
Let's look at Luke 1:41 in the NASB [verse read]. That is another verse that we looked at last week where the 1995 NASB was not as literal as the 77 NASB. The 77 NASB had another phrase at the beginning there, it had this idea of - and it came about. So you might remember that was a phrase that was used in the 77 NASB a lot, it was deleted in the 95 NASB, and it continues to be deleted in the 2020 NASB. So the 77 NASB was more literal in this verse. Now take a look though at the NIV of 1984 [read verse]. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any changes? I don't see any changes there, it's exactly the same. The NIV has exactly the same wording as the NASB - they are equally literal in this verse here. So we don't want to get the wrong idea and think that every verse in the NIV is less literal then the corresponding verse in the NASB. That is just not the case. Many verses are equally literal, some are almost as literal, and other verses are a lot less literal - they are doing more of a dynamic equivalent. We've seen different examples of the different approaches in the 1984 NIV. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '32:49', '34:11')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Basically, it's not trying to be super readable all the way through, its increasing the readability in some passages. In others its just kind of leaving it more literal, because the translators felt - OK this is readable enough and we don't have to try to create a dynamic equivalence here. So overall, this is a much more readable translation than the NASB. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '34:10', '34:31')">audio</a>
</p>



<h3 id="NIV-complain">NIV - complaints and uproar about more changes</h3>

<p class="border1">
But it didn't take long, it was actually less than 10 years after the 84 NIV was released that people started to complain that the translation was not readable enough, it needed to increase in readability. And so the main area where the NIV was criticized had to do with gender. And I already read to you an example from Psalm 1:1 where it says blessed is the man, and even the 2020 NASB has updated that now and it says blessed is the person. Well there are many examples and 84 NIV where it was very masculine where it doesn't need to be. And so people were criticizing it for that and they said we want to make some changes. And so in 1992 the translators of the NIV start working on a new edition that was more gender inclusive. And this translation was finished in 1996. It was called the New International Version Inclusive Language Edition and it was abbreviated NIVI. The final I there stands for inclusive there and I guess they didn't bother with the L and the E there at the end to make it a really long acronym.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '34:31', '35:35')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
You probably never heard of this edition of the NIV because and that's because it was only published in the United Kingdom across the ocean there in Great Britain. But then the very next year in 1997, a magazine called World Magazine - they're still around, I checked them out yesterday to see if they are still in business and they are, a good solid Christian conservative magazine that just reports on Christian news. Well they came out with a duzy of an article in March of 1997. They reported that there were plans to make a gender neutral revision of the NIV in the United States. The World Magazine article referred to it in the title as the stealth bible. And the reason they called it the stealth bible was because the translators and the committee for the NIV, they were keeping their plans very much a secret, very hidden. They were not wanting people to know about what they were doing because they knew that people would be upset about all these different changes that they were wanting to make to the gender in the NIV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '35:34', '36:33')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
And so within 2 months there was such an uproar after this article was published that the committee in charge of translating the NIV - they released a statement saying that they were not going to make any changes to the gender language in the NIV - they weren't going to make any updates to gender related changes. It did not take long however for those translators on the committee to break their word. They came out in public and released a statement saying they weren't gonna make any gender related changes, but then two years later in a 1999, they announced that they were going to put out a new edition of the NIV in the United States that would include changes in a gender language. And this translation was called Today's New International Version (TNIV). This one you probably are familiar with, you might have heard of the TNIV. It was first published as just the new testament in 2002 and then in 2005 the whole bible was finished. And this translation met with very strong opposition throughout the United States. There were many questionable changes made to this edition of the NIV especially related to gender language.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '36:33', '37:43')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
There was a whole host of different christian leaders who criticized the translation - they were pointing out the various problems with it. And all this opposition meant that the TNIV never really caught on, it never really sold very well, they printed lots of copies of it, but they just weren't able to sell very many. And that's because most people who used the 1984 version of the NIV just kept on using the NIV, they didn't switch to the TNIV, they weren't comfortable with it, it had too many questionable changes. And so after a couple of years the translators of the TNIV, this committee that oversaw the NIV and all the editions of it, they realized their mistake here and they decided to pull the plug on the TNIV, but also to pull the plug on the 1984 NIV. And what they decided to do with replace both of these translations with a brand new revised NIV. And this one would just be called the NIV and it would replace this older 1984 NIV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '37:43', '38:42')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
This translation was published in 2011. And if you were here in our church we talked about it because we used to use the 1984 NIV in our preaching and teaching here. And when this new NIV came out we did not jump over to it. We switched to a different translation instead, the Christian standard bible which we thought was a better choice for a translation that's more readable. And that's because there were just so many problems here with the new 2011 NIV. This edition of the NIV basically end up being a lot like the TNIV, it was much more like the TNIV than it was the 1984 NIV. I basically view this change as a stunt or switcheroo where they say - you don't want to buy the TNIV well we'll force you to. We'll just rename it as the NIV and we'll get rid of the one that you like and we're not let you buy it any more. And I'm not going to say it's unethical, but it's definitely a little bit questionable what they're up to there. I'm not going to say that all the changes to the 2011 NIV were bad, and they didn't keep all the changes in the TNIV. They did make some improvements that didn't go as far as the TNIV did, but there were still many things in the 2011 NIV that were problematic.

</p>


<h3 id="NIV-good">NIV - some good changes in the 2011</h3>

<p class="border1">
But before we look at the problems in the new NIV, let's look at some of the good changes in the 2011 NIV. Cause there were quite a few improvements to this newer edition of the NIV. Let's start in the old testament with Leviticus 19:10. Here is the 1984 NIV and then we'll compare it to the 2011 NIV. [read verse, 84 NIV]. Now look at the 2011 NIV. [read verse]. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '39:51', '40:31')">audio</a>

<tr><td>NIV 84</td><td>Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the alien. I am the Lord your God.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
There is only one word that's changed here. Can you find it? Alien has changed to a foreigner. And that makes sense right, they would make that change because how many science fiction movies and TV shows have appeared since 1984, right? So we don't want people reading the NIV and thinking - O they're talking about extraterrestrial life here. The Hebrew word there just refers to a foreigner. That what the word alien used to refer to - a foreigner, not so much anymore. So this is a good change in the NIV. It is not misleading anymore it's very accurate. That's the only change they made here from the 1984 NIV. So I do like this verse in the updated NIV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '40:31', '41:08')">audio</a>

</table>


<p class="border1">
Let's look at another example of a good change in the 2011 NIV. Luke 17:20b-21. Verse 20 is long so I only included the last part of the verse. This is Jesus is speaking here. The first part of the verse is just giving the context of what Jesus is saying here, but we don't really need it [to compare translations]. Here's what the 84 NIV says [verse read]. Now look at the change here in the 2011 NIV [verse read]. Now there are a couple of different changes here but I only want to focus on one because we're running out of time. Look at the very end of this passage, and what's the change here? It changes from "within you" to "in your midst". That's a very important change. Within you means inside of you, in your midst just means around you - close by, but not necessarily within you. And this is an improved interpretation because Jesus is talking to the unbelieving Pharisees here. Would he really say the kingdom of God is inside of them? No, because they rejected Jesus as their messiah. Its much more likely that Jesus is just simply talking about himself as the king over God's kingdom and how he is right there are among them. He's  someone who's basically prepared to set up his kingdom if they will simply submit to him and accept him as their king. But they rejected him. That's what this verse I think is talking about. And the new NIV is reflecting that more accurate interpretation here with this change. The other changes are not quite as significant here I think the updated NIV is more helpful and the other changes as well, but the change in the end there is what really is important.

<p class="border1">
Lets look at another verse in the NIV to compare the two editions here. Let's look at John 6:35 starting with the 84 NIV [verse read]. Now look at the 2011 NIV [verse read]. What's the change here in the newer NIV? It's one change that happens twice and that's it, no other changes. Yeah, its whoever instead of he who. Well that word he there doesn't really come from the original text. It's not necessary to have a masculine pronoun here. This is an example of an appropriate gender change in the NIV. There were many areas of the NIV that were too masculine. We're going to see next week that there are many places where the NIV made inappropriate changes to gender, but not all the gender changes were inappropriate. This is an example of good change I think. This is the sort of thing we saw with the NASB last week in the 2020 edition. They were making some appropriate gender changes. And the NIV made these sort of changes as well in 2011.

<p class="border1">
Let's look now at Romans chapter 3:28 starting in the 84 NIV [verse read]. Now look at the 2011 NIV [verse read]. There are two changes here. What's the first one? man to person - this is another appropriate gender change. The Greek word for man can also refer to a person of either gender. Again we saw this sort of change in a NASB last week. This is appropriate. What's the other change? It changes from observing the law to the works of the law. And the new NIV is more literal here. This is the exact phrase that we would find in the NASB if I were to put it on the screen. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '44:09', '44:57')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
The older NIV is giving us more of a dynamic equivalence here. So this is a change toward being more literal than the updated NIV and this is good, because, while I think if your understanding what that word observing means in the older NIV, you getting the right idea. Its talking about doing the work of law, right, but somebody might read that phrase and say "Well if I just read the law - OK I can't be saved by reading the law - but maybe I can be saved by doing the law. That's not what its saying.  The word observing there is referring to doing in the law, but that might mislead somebody, that's kind of an older use of the word observe there. Most people might hear the word observe and just think means to look at something. That's not what the NIV translators had in mind and so I think it probably should've been changed to doing the law instead of observing the law, just to be more clear, that would have been a better dynamic equivalence. But why not just keep it literal here? I think most people can figure out what it means when you talk about the works of the law - its talking about doing the works of the law. We don't have to spell it out ultra-clearly to people.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at another example, 1 Timothy 3:11 - here is the 1984 NIV [verse read]. In this chapter Paul was giving the qualifications for two different offices in the church. The office of elder and the office of deacon. And this verse comes right in the middle of the qualifications for deacons. So it kind of seems to come just out of nowhere here. And what the NIV 84 seems to be saying is that these are wives of deacons that Paul was talking about. But that is not the only way to interpret this verse. Look at the 2011 NIV [verse read]. Well this is almost exactly the same except the word wives is no longer there. There is another way to interpret this verse. It could be referring to female deacons, or what we would call deaconesses. And this is a very prominent translation, I think this probably has the majority of scholars on this side. And the NIV of 2011 is leaving the interpretation open here - it could be referring to wives, wives are women right, but it could be referring to other women as well, not the wives of deacons, but just women in general who would also serve along with the male deacons. These would be female deacons or deaconesses. I'm not inclined to take that interpretation, I do think its probably referring to wives, but the Greek word here can refer to just women in general or wives. And I do think it's wise of the NIV to leave it open - like a reader decide - let them think about the different options here, and decide for themselves which interpretation they think is accurate. There are plenty of good people on both sides here. So I'm definitely open to the deaconess view, I just think that the wife view is probably stronger - it's a close call.

I wish I had time to go into it but were almost out of time. Lets go into one final verse here where I want to compare these two editions of the NIV. 1 John 2:16 - this is a familiar one because we looked at it earlier. Here's the 84 NIV again [verse read]. And you'll remember that this is not a very literal translation here. In fact, there are some interpretive problems here. But now look at the 2011 NIV [verse read]. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt7, '47:46', '48:27')">audio</a>
</p>

<table border=1><caption>1 John 2:16</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NIV 2011</td><td>For everything in the world-the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life-comes not from the Father but from the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NIV 84</td><td>For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
Well that sounds almost exactly like the NASB which I put up earlier. It's very literal there in that middle section. Now they have the word lust there twice, now they have the word flesh there, now it says pride of life at the end of that - the three phrases there instead of boasting of what he has and does. So this is a more literal translation. Its not misleading you into taking the wrong interpretation about any of these phrases. And again its just kind of letting the reader decide - what does the word flesh mean? There are different possibilities. What is the pride of life referring to? Different possibilities again. So this is another good change in the 2011 NIV. I do like the 2011 NIV in all these different verses here that we've look at, I think it improves on the 84 NIV in a variety of ways. And if these were the only changes in the 2011 NIV then I can definitely recommend it to you. But unfortunately there were many other changes in the 2011 NIV that were not so good. And so we will pick up and look at those next week. Come back next week, I'll leave you on another cliff-hanger and we will look at some other problems in the 2011 NIV. Let's close in prayer.

Thank you so much for your word Lord, and thank you that we can study a variety of different passages that are so powerful and have such good application for us today. And yet we sometimes aren't sure about the best way to handle these verses, how to translate them, how to interpret them. Thank you that we have a variety of bible translation that we can look at and compare the verses to each other and try to arrive at the best understanding of them. So I pray you'd give us wisdom as we continue to evaluate bible translations. Help us to be able to hone in on the best ones and then help us Lord to be motivated to make regular use of them so that we can grow in our knowledge of you. In Jesus name. Amen.

Well we're now in the 8th week of our study of bible translations. Unfortunately though, we've only covered 1 bible translation that I recommend to you. Does anyone remember which translation that is? If there's anything you remember - it should be the translations I recommend. If that's the only thing you remember from this class, hopefully you'll remember which translations does Brad recommend. So what's the 1 translation I recommended so far? NASB - the New American Standard Bible - I could not recommend the KJV, the ASV, the RSV, for various reasons - different types of problems in them - very difficult to read, poor manuscript support, theological problems, there are a variety of different problems with those different translations. Some are worse than others. But all of them are not good enough to receive recommendation from me.

The NASB out shines all of them, there will be others I can recommend later, but so far the NASB has been the only one. The best feature the NASB is how literal it is, its a pretty literal bible translation. It leans much more toward formal equivalence than toward dynamic equivalence. And I told you last week - or two weeks ago I guess - that I would put the NASB on a scale of 1 to 100, at the number 17. So 1 is very literal, extremely literal, 100 is not literal at all. And the NASB leans much more toward the number 1. I wouldn't put any translation below 10, because all bible translations have a certain amount of dynamic equivalence. But the NASB is pretty close to that 10, not the most literal bible translation, but pretty literal. And so its very valuable for careful bible study.

<h3 id="intro2">NIV introduction</h3>

<p class="border1">
Last week, we start looking at a new bible translation, the NIV. And this followed directly on the heels of the NASB - the NASB was first published back in the 60s in smaller portions and finally the whole bible was published in 1971. Well, the NIV was first published right after 1971. In 1973, the new testament was published and then 1978 of the whole bible was finished. So that's just 7 years after the whole bible for the NASB came out. It was revised in 1984. And so the 1984 edition is what we used our church for many years. And then it was revised again in 2011. The NIV was designed primarily to be a readable bible translation, to be more readable than all those previous translations that I mentioned, like the NASB and the KJV. That was the main goal with his translation. And so as a result the translators were utilizing dynamic equivalence regularly in this translation, much more frequently than in these other translations that we looked at. And so we took a look at a couple of verses last week where we can see that clearly, like Amos 4:6. That verse has a phrase that can be literally translated "cleanness of teeth". That's how it translated in the KJV, the NASB, and so on. But that could mislead people into thinking - O they're talking about dental hygiene. No, that's not really the idea there when you study the context and you see what else is going on in that passage. It's clear that the reason that the people's teeth were clean is that they weren't eating, they were going hungry. And so their teeth weren't getting stained with food. And so the NIV uses dynamic equivalence there, they have the phrase "empty stomachs". That's not a literal translation, but it does get to the underlying meaning of what's going on there. And they're doing that first to make it more readable, a little smoother, and then more comprehensible, more understandable as a result.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '01:36', '03:34')">audio</a>

<p class="border1">
So the NIV is pretty readable, that's the feature of it that has drawn a lot of people to it. The NIV has been the most popular bible translation in English since the mid 1980s. The KJV reigned supreme from the 1600s all the way up to the mid 1980s. It was the top dog, the bestselling English bible translation all those years, and finally the NIV kicked it off its throne in the mid 1980s. And it been the top bible translation ever since. But it wasn't long after the mid 1980s that some people became unhappy with various aspects of the NIV. And the main area where the NIV was criticized had to do with gender. There is a lot of masculine language in the 1984 edition of the NIV. And there were some people who want to get rid of that, and replace it with language that is more gender neutral. And so that led to several editions of the NIV that were published. And these were controversial editions, because of that shift toward gender neutral language. The first one of these editions of the NIV is called the NIVI - that stands for New International Version Inclusive Language Edition. So the I stands for "Inclusive Language Edition" there. So that was 1996 - that was a very controversial translation, only published in Great Britain though. So it never really gained any traction here of course. Then in 2005 the TNIV was published - that stands for Today's New International Version. And that was similar to the NIVI in that it moved much more toward a gender neutral language. And so both of these translations were criticized by conservative bible believing Christians because, there was such a strong shift toward gender neutral language in those two translations. The TNIV especially because that was published for use in the United States. That was written in American English. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '03:34', '05:31')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
So the TNIV is a much more well known in the United States than the NIVI - you may never heard of the NIVI - but the TNIV you probably have heard of, cause that was marketed more heavily in the United States and pushed very strongly in 2005, and in the years after that. But neither of those two bible translations was really that popular. Most people who use the 1984 NIV just kept on using it, they did not switch to one of these newer editions, because of all the negative publicity about it from the conservative folks who were criticizing it. They said well we're just going to keep using the 1984 NIV, why change then, we like this and we're hearing some stuff about these newer editions we don't like, so we're not gonna switch. Well after a couple of years then the publisher decides - well we can't tolerate this, we want people to switch to something newer, and so we're just gonna replace the old NIV, we're going to git rid of that, we're going to update it, and come out with a new edition and is just going to be call the NIV. That actually how most translations are handled. They just go through updates and they retain the same name. The NIV went in a different direction where they came up with adapted names, TNIV, but they kept the old NIV.

<p class="border1">
Well, in 2011 that ceased, the NIV of 1984 was no longer being published, it was no longer being printed - you can find some copies that are used or leftovers in bookstores and that sort of thing. Probably even still today you might be able to get your hands on a 1984 NIV. But its no longer printed, it is no longer published, its been replaced by this 2011 NIV. This is the current edition of the NIV, there's been no new editions since then. And the 2011 NIV is very similar to the TNIV. Most of the changes in the TNIV have been incorporated into the 2011 NIV. So this is kind of a quick little switcheroo here that they pulled - where they said "you don't wanna buy the TNIV, well we'll force you to, we're going to replace your NIV with a new NIV that's basically the TNIV. It has most of the changes to the TNIV, now they're in the NIV. Now I'm not saying that this is totally bad, that none of the changes were good. Last week we looked at some passages where I thought the 2011 NIV was better, that they made some good changes. In Leviticus 19, the old NIV has the word alien which makes you think about science fiction shows. But that's not of course what the verse is talking about. Its talking about a foreigner and that is what the 2011 NIV has. In Luke 17, the old NIV said the kingdom of God was in was within the Pharisees. Well that's not really accurate because they weren't saved. So there's no sense in which we can say the kingdom of God was within them. No the new NIV changes that and says it's in their midst, it's it's in their presence, meaning Jesus as the king is right there in their presence. That's a good change there, that's a better interpretation. There's also places where the 2011 NIV is actually more literal than the old NIV. In Romans 3 and several other passages - we looked at Romans 3 - we saw this phrase the works of law in the 2011 NIV. And that's a literal translation - you could find that phrase in the NASB. The old NIV had observing the law which is more interpretive and a little bit misleading - are you just saying that you can't be saved by reading the law? But that you could be saved by doing it? No, not at all, that's not the implication there. So that's a little bit misleading, not a very good translation (the old NIV), and its better in the new NIV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '06:45', '09:04')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
In Romans 3, we see a statement about a person being justified by faith where the old NIV said a man was justified by faith. Well, maybe that would mislead people into thinking that only men can be justified - I would hope not, but it's possible. The Greek word there can refer to a person of either gender so that's an appropriate change. Those sorts of changes were incorporated into the most recent edition of the NASB as well. So there are some appropriate gender changes that were made to the 2011 NIV. There are a variety of improvements that we can see, but some of the changes to the 2011 NIV, I could probably even say many of the changes made to the 2011 NIV, we're not so good. And so we're going to start today by looking at several examples where the changes in the 2011 NIV were not so good. If the only changes that were made were the sort of changes we saw last week, I could still recommend this translation. That is not the case though, some of them were not so good.

<!--
Technical difficulties edited out.
So let's go back to Psalm 1:1. I was supposed to put this verse on the screen for you last week, and i had a mistake there, where it was a different verse. But I was already planning to circle back to this and compare it to the 2011 NIV so now we get to look at it. 
-->

<p class="border1">
So here's the 1984 NIV for this verse [Psalm 1:1 verse read]. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the reason I was showing you, trying to show you this verse last week, is its actually a pretty literal translation. It's not really that much different from the old KJV and the NASB which are literal translations. A couple of different word choices, but there still literal translations, even if the words are a little different. It's still kind of a word for word translation from the original Hebrew. So this is a pretty good verse in the old NIV - it shows that sometimes in the old NIV it was pretty literal. And the new NIV is also fairly literal at times. But look in this verse now what's happened in the 2011 NIV [verse read]. There are quite a few changes here aren't there? What are some of these changes? Can you see some there? Point some out to me. Yeah, the first one there is the word man has been replaced by the word one. This is another example of a good gender change here, the Hebrew word can refer to either gender, and I don't think the Psalmist was trying to say this only applies to men. I think he's speaking more generally. So I like that change, that's an appropriate change.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '10:16', '11:38')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
These other changes here aren't quite as good though. What else is changed? Okay, in the old NIV we had the word council, and that's a literal translation. There is a Hebrew word here that means council or advice, some translations have advice there, same idea, those are synonyms. What's happened in the new NIV though? There's no word council, there's no word advice, it just says does not walk in step with the wicked. And that kind of changes the meaning doesn't it? Now it's kind of picturing you as walking alongside them or following in the footsteps maybe, you know, where they go you go. Well, that's different than listening to the council right. It's kind of similar but with council you're hearing words and then you're putting those words into action. It's not specifically talking about following the example of someone. So this is not as literal of a translation, and that's not necessarily a problem, but when its not representing the meaning accurately, then it is a problem. And so that's the case here.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '11:38', '12:36')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
What about in the next phrase there? does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way of sinners. Well that's the old NIV. Here the new NIV says the way that sinners take. So again, this is more readable, more interpretive, not as literal, but its just trying to convey the meaning accurately and I think it actually does hit the nail on the head here. When we talk about the way of sinners, its talking about following in the same way they they go. So this is kind of talking about following their example. And that's what the new NIV is conveying - following in the way that sinners take. Wherever they go you go. So that change I think is helpful, it's not as literal, but I think it still gets the idea across in just a slightly more readable way.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '12:36', '13:22')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
What about the last phrase, what's changed there? Yeah, seat is replaced by company. And in the Hebrew there is a word that means seat there. That's a literal translation in the old NIV, its kind of redundant right because you have sit and then seat, but those 2 Hebrew words come from the same root, they refer to the same idea. So this is conveying some emphasis here. The old NIV helps you to see that emphasis. So that's helpful for careful bible study - the old NIV is more literal here in this verse. The new NIV is taking a more dynamic equivalent approach here - sitting in the company of mockers. The problem though I think with this dynamic equivalent is that it kind of is not preserving the meaning very accurately in this verse. It's probably not the right interpretation. To sit in the seat of mockers has the idea of identifying with them, and acting like them, so the focus isn't really on being in their company. Perhaps that's implied here, but to sit in their seat I think is the idea of you're just doing what they're doing. But to sit in the company of mockers has the idea that you're just hanging out with them. So again it's not totally off, but it does kind of shift the idea a little bit away from the literal understanding of this verse. When you just look at a literal translation, what's the idea that you get from it? Well its a little bit different than what the NIV is saying here when they're interpreting this. So the new NIV is not as literal here, and in some places it's helpful, in other places it's not. It's not as accurate as before. So this is a verse in the new NIV that I don't think is as good as it was in the old NIV. This is a poor change, a series of poor changes in this verse.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at another change in the 2011 NIV that wasn't so good. Let's look at Matthew 6:24 starting with the old NIV from 1984 [verse read].
Alright, now who is speaking in this verse, anybody know? Take a guess if you're not sure, and you'd probably be right. Yes, Jesus. Anybody know where the sermon on the mount is in the gospel of Matthew? I'll give you a hint - it includes this chapter. Chapters 5-7, yeah, this is right in the middle of the sermon on the mount - you've got a chapter before and a chapter after it that are part of the sermon as well. That may seem like a long sermon, 3 chapters, its long compared to other sermons in scripture, but you can read those three chapters in fifteen minutes. It's not the full sermon Jesus preached, it kind of a summary of a sermon he preached I think. It would have been hard for them to preserve the whole thing I suspect. Alright, let's look now at the 2011 NIV and see what this translation has Jesus saying [verse read]. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '15:05', '16:21')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Now there aren't as many changes in this verse compared to Psalm 1:1, so it might be harder to spot changes, but can you see any changes? Ah, there are 2 pronouns that have changed. Its the same pronoun, what's the pronoun? [A student answered - he and you]. Yeah, he in the old NIV has been changed to you in the new NIV. There is another very small change there that has to do with capitalization. In the old NIV, they capitalized the word money. I think that's probably just because its put alongside God, whose a person, and we capitalized God, so I guess they were just capitalize Money. Probably not the best way to go, so the new NIV doesn't do that, and that's an appropriate change. Its just talking about money kind of figuratively as a person, but it's not a name, so I don't think we should capitalize it. That's a very minor change - but one that I think is good in the new NIV. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '16:21', '17:10')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
The other change here though - not so good, right? Notice that there is a 2nd person pronoun here that is present in both translations, do you see it - you cannot serve both God and money. The translations agree on that one - they're both accurately preserving the fact that there is the 2nd person plural verb in the original Greek there, translated "you serve". And then there's a word that means not in there as well to negate that idea. So they're correct there, but in the middle of the verse in the original Greek, we have a 3rd person singular verbs. So the old NIV conveys that accurately with a masculine pronoun. The masculine pronoun has traditionally been the pronoun you use when you want to pick out sort of a representative individual and refer to with a gender. You could use the singular, but that's just less common. Usually we would just say he. But these days people are kind of becoming unhappy with that, and so they find ways to tweak things, so that they don't have to use those masculine pronouns so much. They want something more gender neutral, and so what the NIV translators did here is they changed it from a 3rd person to a 2nd person. And this is not literal and it's not accurate because in the original text we have 3rd person here, not 2nd person in the middle of this verse. The reason it matters is that Jesus shifts at the end of this verse, he shifts from 3rd person to 2nd person. Do we know exactly why he did that? I don't know - it's hard to say why he did that shift, but the fact is that he did it. He used a 3rd person then he shifted to a 2nd person. You would not know about that shift in the 2011 NIV, because they're not translating the middle of this verse literally, they're misleading you about the language that Jesus used. Now this doesn't change much of the meaning of it, but you are losing some of the nuance, you're loosing some of the detail here. And I think the key here is - what is motivating this change? What is motivating this change is the desire to avoid using masculine language - that's the issue here. And that's being driven by a push toward feminism in our culture here. And this is not something that we can go along with as Christians. And so I wouldn't say that this is the final battle-ground on which we are going fight against feminism, but it is a small issue that's kind of on the way to that hill that we should die on. So this is steering us in the wrong direction here. It's steering us away from accuracy and faithfulness to the original text, and steering us more toward gender neutrality. And it doesn't really improve the readability of the translation, its just trying to avoid offending people. But scripture is offensive in many places and we shouldn't try to make it less offensive and diminish the accuracy at the same time. So the change here is just totally motivated by a desire to be gender neutral, its not a desire to be more readable. Its not more readable, is just more gender neutral, and it's going to far in my opinion. You can make some gender changes in the 1984 NIV - this is going too far.

Let me show you another example of an inappropriate change involving gender in the 2011 NIV. Take a look there at John 14:23 in the old NIV [verse read]. Now look at the 2011 NIV [verse read].
OK, hopefully you caught these changes here since I clued you in to what to look for. What's changed? The pronouns again, right. Oh yeah, the first one is if - if is gone. There's a conditional statement in the original Greek here translated literally in the NIV - and that conditional statement has been reformatted now. And so we can't tell that Jesus is using a conditional statement here 'cause its just been reworded. And why do you think - do you think they have something against conditional statements? I don't think so. What's the motivation for changing the conditional statement? What other word have they changed here besides deleting the word if in the opening sentence. he - they've been able to remove the word he by changing the sentence, right. Anyone who loves me will obey. So instead of he will obey, its just anyone who loves me will obey. They wanted to delete the word he - that was the motivation for changing the conditional sentence here. And then in the rest of this verse we see 3 words change, right - him, him, and him. him, him, and him have all been changed to them in each case. So before we saw change from 3rd person to 2nd person. What change specifically are we seeing here with the pronouns? Its not changing to 2nd person right? Its still 3rd person, but there is some other change here, what's the grammatical change? Yeah, from singular masculine to plural. Yes, and this not accurate. The original Greek did not have plural pronouns here, this is just change to try and be more gender neutral. And now we have a pronoun antecedent disagreement here, notice. We have a singular antecedent anyone. And then we have plural pronouns referring back to that singular antecedent. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '20:07', '22:26')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
If I had done this in my English class in college, I'd have lost a whole letter grade for this, for having the wrong pronouns. Now it is true that in modern English there is an increasing tendency to use plural pronouns to refer back to singular words, to singular nouns. And we do this in our spoken language without even thinking about it. If you just listen to your-self talk and you'll hear yourself do that from time to time, cause there is a shift underway in the English language. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that shift has not a finished yet, and there is still disagreement among English grammarians, among the people who put together English style guides, whether its the Chicago style guide, or the AP style guide, or whatever the style guide is that you look at. You will find disagreements when you compare them to each other. Some will say do it the way it is in the old NIV, some will say do it the way it is in the new NIV. And that's the indication that there's still a shift underway, and who knows, maybe it'll shift back to where it came from. We're still in the middle of the shift and it's still hard to say which way its going to go. What's happening is the NIV translators are jumping the gun and they're saying we're going to get ahead of this, and we're going to jump on board with the direction of the culture's going in. Even though the motivation for the culture making this shift is a feminist motivation. It is a desire to diminish masculinity, and to attack masculinity. And so this is very concerning I think that the NIV translators have jumped the gun on this. Okay, if one day all the style guides say you should not use a 3rd person singular to refer back to a singular antecedent used in the plural, OK, then I guess we'll follow along with that. You know that happened with that 2nd person pronoun - we used to be able to to distinguish between singular and plural, now we can't, so now we're just all on board now with the word you, whether it's singular or plural. One day that may happen with a 3rd person pronouns too - it hasn't happened yet. And so I think that we should stick with the older traditional approach, until there has been a full transformation, and let's try to resist that, right. Why would we wanna let go of this, I don't see a good reason to do that. I think it can only be motivated by the the push of feminism, that's really whats motivating this. So here is another change in the NIV that I think is inappropriate. And by the way, I could have given you dozens of examples of 3rd person to 2nd person, and dozens of more examples from singular to plural. There all over the place in the 2011 NIV. I just picked one of each example 'cause I don't want to be doing this next week, I want to finish up the NIV today.

And there are other examples that are problems, so let's look at another example of a problematic verse in the 2011 NIV. Let's look at John 19:7. Here is the 1984 NIV [verse read]. Now its obvious that the word he is referring to Jesus there, right. But who are the Jews talking to - do you have any idea? Anybody know what's going on here? Or do you want to take a guess?  Who are the Jews telling that Jesus should die? [A student answered the leaders, but can't remember their names]. Yeah, the Jewish religious leaders are probably talking here, but who are they talking to? [A student answered the Romans]. Yeah, the Romans. Who is the leader of the Romans in this area - Pilate, yeah he was the governor. So the Jews are talking to Pilate here. Now let's take a look at the 2011 NIV now that we understand what's going [verse read]. Now there's hardly any change here - word for word its basically the same as the 84 NIV, but there is one significant change here. What is it? In the old NIV, it just says Jews, in the new NIV it says Jewish leaders. Well there is no Greek word here for leaders, there's just one Greek word, and it just means Jews, it just refers to Jews in general. But in the 2011 NIV, they've decided "you know what, we think that only the Jewish leaders are speaking here and not the Jews in general". So they're kind of making an interpretation here, and I do think that this could be problematic. It could be accurate, but it's probably an issue here. And I think what we need to do is get to the heart of why this change was made. Can you think of a reason why the translators would want to make a change here? This is kind of subtle, but maybe it will come to you. If not then I'll help you out. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '24:51', '26:51')">audio</a>
</p>


<p class="border1">
Yeah, they might think that, but underneath this I think is a broader movement that is concerned about leaving it as Jews here. What would be the concern with just leaving it as Jews? Okay, yeah, this verse and others could be used improperly I will say. They could be used as a basis for anti-semitism. Throughout history, different people have tried to use the bible as the tool for getting rid of the Jews. And I'm sure you all know of a very prominent example, right? Who is the most prominent example of someone who tried to get rid of the Jews - and used scripture to defend it? Adolf Hitler, yeah. I'm not sure that he actually believes scripture taught that if he used it as a tool, as part of his argument, for why we need to get rid of the Jews, because look the bible here is speaking against the Jews so we should get rid of the Jews. That is not the right way to interpret what's going on here. So I'm not saying the NIV translators have poor motivations here. If they are motivated as I think they are, to avoid in charge of anti-semitism in the bible - Okay, that's a good motivation. But it's not proper to make a bad change to a translation for a good reason - to do something for good reason, that's a bad thing to do, is not acceptable. We should not be doing that sort of thing. Instead, we just need to explain what is the scripture actually teaching here. I think it's actually likely that there was probably just one individual who said these words. I don't think we should be thinking that a whole bunch of Jews were speaking these words in unison. So why did John not say who was the person who said this, or to narrow in a little more, a Jewish leader said this? Why did he just use the general word for Jews? Well, I think that's pretty obvious, right. One person is a spokesman meaning everybody else agrees with this, they're all on board. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '26:51', '28:48')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
There's nobody in the crowd saying, well I don't agree with that, lest have a debate about this. No they're all on board with this. That's John's intent. He's not saying everybody's saying these words, he's saying there was a spokesman, and everybody agreed with these words. They all, in this group, all these Jews who were before Pilate, all wanted Jesus to die, they all thought he deserved to die. That is what John is trying to convey here. And when we change this and just say Jewish leaders, were kind of removing that implication now of the text. We're trying to basically say well the Jewish leaders are the ones responsible for the death of Jesus. But you know the people in the crowd, you know, they weren't really on board with this. That is not at all what the text implies. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '28:48', '29:24')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And we can confirm this by zooming forward to Acts chapter 2. Remember in Acts chapter 2, after the Holy Spirit came down on believers on the day of Pentecost, Peter preached a sermon, and there's the whole bunch of people there, thousands of people, and look what he says to them [verse read]. Did he say you Jewish leaders or did he say you in general? I think he's saying all of you before me who are listening who were here in Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was put to death. You were all part of this, you participated in this to some degree, and so you are ultimately responsible here for this - you bear responsibility and you need to repent, and later in the passage and we see 3000 people repented. When he confronted them about their sin of putting Jesus to death they repented. They realized we shouldn't have done that. So Peter certainly didn't think that there was a select few people who were responsible for the death of Jesus. He put the blame at the Jews feet in a general.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '29:24', '30:21')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And so the NIV is actually inconsistent here, cause they didn't add you Jewish leaders. That's probably what they should have done if that's what they believed right. But no the translated accurately an Acts 2 - they did not translate accurately in John 17:9. So could the bible be charged as anti-semitic here? No, because we're not saying all Jews of all time did this. It was just Jews who were alive at this time. And not even every single jew. Most Jews we can say. Jews in general, but the text never says all Jews, it just says Jews. Jews in general did this, not all Jews, and certainly not all Jews of all time.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '30:21', '30:58')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Yeah, question. [Student comment: I understand the Jewish leaders have 3 very powerful groups - Sanhedrin, Saducees, & Pharisees, but they didnt agree on anything.] Yeah, they had a lot of disagreements, but on this one they agreed. [Student: Try to put that whole idea, especially if you understand that when you say Jewish leaders - well which ones?] Right, right, yeah, its kind of misleading isn't it and it doesn't really solve anything. And it really is inconsistent with Acts 2 and what Peter was saying there. And I think it kind of also takes away from the sense that really all people all time are sinners. And there's a sense in which we're all indirectly responsible for the death of Jesus. So, okay, could you say that all Jews of all time are somehow responsible for the death of Jesus? Yes, but you could say the same thing about everyone from every race. Jesus was on the cross because all of us are sinners and he's offering salvation to all people. And so when we take away this kind of more universal language in scripture we're kind of diminishing that point of theology I think. This is a change that concerns me, I don't approve of it, and I don't like the direction. Its not just in this verse, this change has been made in 17 verses, most them in John's gospel, but there are a few in other places as well. So I picked a prominent example in John's gospel just to show you one place. But this is not an isolated thing, it happens throughout the gospel of John.

Let's look at another example where the new NIV is not so good. Let's look at Acts 7:20 starting with verse 20 starting with the 84 NIV [verse read].
Anybody know who's speaking here? Who is speaking in Acts chapter 7? And who is he speaking to? Not Paul. Paul arrives on the scene at the very end of this chapter. He was the one who took the cloaks at his feet of the people who were stoning the individual speaking here. [Student: Stephen] Stephen, Stephen was speaking these words. He preached kind a long sermon to the Sanhedrin, the ruling council of Jewish leaders there. He was under arrest for preaching about Jesus - they were unhappy with what he was saying, so they arrested him, they ended up stoning him to death. But he got, got some good words in. When he got a chance to speak, he condemned them basically, because of how they were basically opposing all of God's people throughout their history, and now they're just continuing to do that. Now let's look at the 2011 NIV for this verse [verse read].
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '32:36', '33:50')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Alright, what's changed here? Not much. by his family, not in his father's house here. This is a significant change here isn't it? The 2011 NIV is not giving us a literal translation, a literal translation is - we can see its there in the NIV of 84. There's a Greek word for father and a Greek word for house, that's a very literal translation. The new NIV has a dynamic equivalence. Now okay, is this all little bit more readable? Sure, it's a little smoother, little more readable. But what do you think is the main motivation for this change, now that we've seen a few of the other bad changes in the NIV? 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '33:50', '34:27')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
[student: the gender thing.] Yeah, the gender thing, right. Yeah, we see an emphasis here on the father's house, and this is language that is reflecting scriptural teaching on the father's leadership over the home. The new NIV, because its been influenced by feminism, is trying to steer away from that, and not make any reference to the father's leadership of the home. That's I think what's really going on here, when we look at this change in context with all the other changes that have been made in the 2011 NIV. So we're just continuing to see a drift toward feminism. Feminist hate the biblical teaching about about the wive needing to submit to her husband, and the father's leadership of the home. Scripture teaches very clearly in several places that a wife is to submit to her husband - and we never see that put in reverse, we never see a husband told to submit to his wife. Feminist say well a husband and wife can just lead together, they submit to each other. But that is not what the bible teaches. And so we need to push back against feminism on this and not let them come in and change what the bible teaches about this.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at another change in the 2011 NIV that's not so good. Let's look at Romans 16:1 [84 NIV verse read]. Now look at the 2011 NIV here, Paul's greeting here [verse read].
All right, what change has happened here besides the spelling of Cenchrea(e) - however you pronounce that? Yeah, servant has changed you to deacon. And this kind of reminds us of something we talk about last week, we look at a verse last where we talked about how in 1 Timothy 3 and verse 11, that verse could be referring to deaconesses or maybe to the wives of the deacons. And the new NIV leaves that idea open there, and allows for both interpretations, and they are both possible. But to call a woman a deacon, and not a deaconess I do think is a problem because if we pull up 1 Timothy 3:12, the verse after the one we looked at last week. It speaks very clearly of the qualifications for deacons. We have 2 qualifications listed here, first of all, a deacon must be faithful to his wife and then a deacon must also manage his children and his household well. This is talking about his family life. Well, how's his marriage, how is he doing as a father? That is a big part of the qualifications of a deacon. And what's underlying this whole verse here is the fact that a deacon must be a man. It doesn't say must be faithful to his or her wife or husband. You know there's no language like that in the original text. It just says faithful to his wife. And this is a verse that reflects the father's leadership of the home, that he must manage his children and his household well - he's ultimately responsible for how his children are raised. He can delegate some of that of course, his wife's going to do a lot of it, and there might be servants in the home at this time, or other helpers, but he's ultimately responsible. So the key here is that only may men can be deacons. Elders, the top office in the church, they must be men. And so also the lower office, the servant office. The Greek word here can be translated either way - servant or deacon - only the context helps us to see that. And the new NIV has decided "well we think that Phoebe is a deacon", without really any basis for that change. In fact, there seems to be a contradiction. I do think if they had put the word deaconess here that would be okay. The old NIV actually had a footnote here that said it could be translated deaconess. And that's fine, they still put servant in the text, and I do lean that way myself. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '35:27', '38:04')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
But deaconess would be OK as well, but to say deacon, well we have that same word deacon in this verse here, 1 Timothy, and its saying that he must be a man, so this leaves a problem here I think that wouldn't be easy for people to resolve without knowing what's going on here - and comparing to other translations. So this is another poor change in the 2011 NIV. Once again we're seeing a drift toward feminism, a desire to appoint women into leadership positions in the church that are not appropriate.

</table>

<p class="border1">
Let's look at one more negative change to the 2011 NIV. Look at 1 Timothy 2:12, first the old NIV [verse read]. Now here's the 2011 NIV [verse read].
There are 2 changes here in the new NIV, what are they? Assume instead of have, and whats the other one? quiet instead of silent. I think the second change is no problem, those are roughly synonymous. If anything, quiet is probably more accurate because the idea of silent there might convey the idea that a woman can never open her mouth and say anything in the church gatherings, and I don't think that is the idea in context. The idea in context has to do with just not teaching in the gathered services where there are men there. And the word quiet I think, maybe conveys the idea a little more accurately, helps people to figure that out. The other change here though is more problematic. To change from have to assume, now opens the door for a woman to have authority over a man in the church, which I think would include teaching, that's why these are alongside each other. How is that the case? What you think of when you hear the word assume - to assume authority? 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '38:30', '39:52')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Yeah, if she asks for permission and gets permission now she's not assuming authority, right. She's been granted authority by the leaders in the church, now she can teach, now she can lead in the church over men. But that is not what Paul's talking about here. He's just talking about having any authority in general. This is a miss-translation and once again its motivated by this drift toward feminism in our culture. We looked at this verse earlier with the KJV. The KJV also has to word assume here, but most translations since then have just had the word have, the word exercise, because it is the more literal accurate translation. I think the word assume probably did at one point in time just mean have and maybe that's why the KJV has it. If that's the case, then it's just the misleading term, it's not what they originally intended to convey, 'cause words change meaning. But these days, to use the word assume here, it conveys a specific idea that's is just not accurate. The 2011 NIV is is once again drifting toward feminism in this verse. So my conclusion here is that I cannot recommend the 2011 NIV.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '39:52', '40:57')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
I do not have a big problem with the dynamic equivalence in the translation, that's not a huge problem as long as you're using the translation for the right for the right purpose, and that your cautious about trying to use it for careful bible study, but it has its place. That's not the main problem here - the problem is that it's drifting toward feminism. They're making a lot of changes to it here in the newest edition that are inappropriate, that are misleading, that are not accurate. So I cannot recommend this translation. The old NIV I could recommend, the 1984 edition, I thought that was fine. Yeah, there were some things that need to be updated, but nothing that was really serious. So the 2011 NIV fixed some of those issues, but they went too far, and they made too many changes that were inappropriate. So I can't recommend this edition.

<h3 id="nirv2">New International Readers Version (NIRV)</h3>

<p class="border1">
However, there is another edition of the NIV that we still need to cover. We haven't covered all the editions of the NIV yet. And so we've now covered the 1984 NIV,  the 2011 NIV, I mentioned earlier the NIVI, the TNIV, those were all different editions of the NIV. There's one more than I want to cover and I think this makes it complete, now we'll be covering all these editions of the NIV. This other edition is called the New International Readers Version or NIRV for short.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '41:42', '42:11')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
This was a translation that was designed to be even easier to read than the NIV. The NIV is already fairly easy to read, but the translator's decided "hey let's make an edition that's even easier to read". And this came along quite a bit later. The original NIV came around back in the 70s - this is about 20 years later when they came around to make this new update, a separate translation for a different purpose. So the new testament was done in 95, the whole bible in 96, and there was a revision in 98, that's very common - you know typos, fixing you know obvious errors. So in 98 they had a revision, and then there was a new revision more recently in 2014. The 98 edition and the original edition of course, those were based on the 1984 NIV, but this 2014 edition of the NIRV, this update brought be translation into conformity with the 2011 NIV. So I think you can already figure out where this is going. But let me go ahead and make some comparisons for you just so that you can see it on the screen.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '42:11', '43:12')">audio</a>

<p class="border1">
Let's compare the 1998 NIRV with the 2014 NIRV and see if we see the same kinds of changes that we saw in the NIV, the less readable edition here, the main translation. So we'll start here with Matthew 6:24. We're just going to look at a couple of the verses that we looked at earlier. So here's Matthew 6:24 in the 1998 NIRV, and you'll be able to see right away just how readable this is - there are shorter sentences, easier vocabulary - it's much more readable [verse read]. 
So notice how how smooth that is, how easy it is to read, fewer sentences than before, and easier vocabulary. This is the kind of wording here that even a young child can understand, or somebody who's learning English as a second language, and doesn't have a big vocabulary yet. This could be helpful for that person. But let's see now what changed in the next edition, the 2014 edition of the NIRV [verse read]. Alright, what's changed? Do we see the same change here? Yeah we do, the pronouns changed again from 3rd person singular masculine to 2nd person. So the update has reflected the 2011 NIV, and the change that we saw there. So that's not a good thing.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at another example that we saw earlier - John 19:7. Here's the NIRV from 1998 [verse read]. In the NIV, we saw one whole sentence here. Now we have what - 1, 2, 3 sentences. So this is much easier to read right? But now look at the 2014 NIRV [verse read]. Hardly any change here, but is the change here that we saw earlier? Yup, Jewish leaders instead of Jews. So the same problems we talked about earlier are now being passed on to this readers version.

<p class="border1">
Let's look at one more, the one that we saw the very end of our study of the NIV - 1 Timothy 2:12. Here's the older NIRV from 98 [verse read].
Once again, very readable here. Three different sentences, easy vocabulary. Now look at the 2014 NIRV [verse read]. This is actually a little less readable. It's only 2 sentences instead of 1, but that's not the significant change here. What's the significant change? take, instead of have its the word take. Notice its not the word assume, cause the word assume is more advanced vocabulary, its not a very easy work to understand [young readers or English as a second language]. But they're basically taking the word assume, and the idea there of taking something by force, and they're conveying that into more easy to understand English - take authority. So in other words its not OK for a woman take authority, but she can have it as long as she's not taking it. That is the implication here and it's not what Paul's teaching in this verse.

<h3 id="icb2">International Children's Bible</h3>

<p class="border1">
And we could look at all the other examples where the 2011 NIV changed, we would see all the same sorts of changes. I just want to show you 3 as representatives. So the NIRV is a problem here just like the 2011 NIV - it has the same problems, and so I cannot recommend the 2014 NIRV. In my family, we use the old NIRV from 1998 - we can't update to this newest edition. We're not in use that one, and so are we stuck now? Is there a bible that we can use for young children, for people who are learning English as a second language? If this new updated NIRV is not reliable, what do we turn to, is there something else out there? Well, there is another translation out there that is very, very readable that is designed for young children. It's very easy to read. This translation is called the International Children's Bible or abbreviated ICB.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '46:23', '47:19')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
This kind of has an interesting history. It originally started just as a new testament for deaf people way back in the 70s, 1978. But as you can imagine, that wouldn't have sold a lot of copies, and so eventually after a few years, they made a revision to it, and they re-branded it as a children's version. They didn't change it a whole lot, they kept it very easy to read. But now, they started selling it as a children's version. And then it started to fly off the shelf and it was a lot more popular. The whole bible was finished in 1986. So this is 10 years before the NIRV was made. I think the NIRV, if anything, was intended as competition for the ICB. Hey we want a piece of the market here. We wanna make some money off children's bibles too, why should the ICB make all the money, right? The ICB went through different revisions, 1988, 1999. And then the latest one is 2015.  
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '47:19', '48:09')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
Now actually what's interesting is that the ICB was the very first English bible translation to use a lot of gender neutral language. So if you go back and look at earlier editions of the ICB from 1988 and 1999 you'll see all of the same problems in it that we just saw in the updated NIRV. But in 2015, they made some good changes and they took away a lot of that inappropriate gender neutral language. So the updated edition of the ICB is much better in this area. And I suspect that it was a reaction to the 2014 NIRV - when they saw the NIRV shift more toward a liberal direction toward feminism, they probably said, well we're going to go in the other direction then because there's a whole market of people out there who don't like the NIRV changes. Let's appeal to these people. So I don't know what motivated the changes - that could be part of it, but its kind of fascinating to me that the changes took place the very next year in 2015. So let's go ahead and take a look a this 2015 ICB and compare it to the NIRV from 2014. We'll just look at the same 3 verses we just saw and look at them quickly. I won't even read the NIRV cause I just did that. But look at the ICB [verse read].

<table border=1><caption>Matthew 6:24</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NIRV 2014</td><td>"No one can serve two masters at the same time. You will hate one of them and love the other. Or you will be faithful to one and dislike the other. You can't serve God and money at the same time.["]</td></tr>
<tr><td>ICB 2015</td><td>"No one can be a slave to two masters. He will hate one master and love the other. Or he will follow one master and refuse to follow the other. So you cannot serve God and money at the same time.["]</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
So this is very readable - different than the NIRV, but still very readable and there are some differences here. But look for the differences we've observed before. You see differences here? Or is the ICB just doing the same thing as the NIRV? The middle of the verse does not have 2nd person pronouns. Notice it says he, he will hate one master, he will follow one master. It's accurately translating the pronouns from the original Greek text. The ICB handles this verse much better than the NIRV. I also like the change the word slave there by the way because in the Greek text, the Greek word there does refer to being a slave. And that's the more accurate translation because technically you could be a servant to two different masters, just like you could have two different jobs. But you can not be a slave to two differ masters. So this preserves what Jesus was actually talking about. It's unfortunate that so many translations don't like to use the word slave because its kind of offensive to people. But I'm glad the ICB is not afraid to do that here and it preserves the accurate meaning in this verse.

<table border=1><caption>John 19:7</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NIRV 2014</td><td>The Jewish leaders replied, "We have a law. That law says he must die. He claimed to be the Son of God."</td></tr>
<tr><td>ICB 2015</td><td>The Jews answered, "We have a law that says he should die, because he said he is the Son of God."</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
Alright now lets look at John 19:7. The ICB says [verse read]. The change there we were looking for is Jews. The ICB thankfully has the word Jews, not Jewish leaders. They actually do that only 16 out of 17 times where the NIRV changes it. I don't know why they have Jewish leaders in one of the 17 places, so that's unfortunate that they can go all the way and steer clear of this totally, but at least its much better than the NIRV here. So its not a perfect translation with regards to this issue, but it's much better than the NIRV.

<table border=1><caption>1 Timothy 2:12</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NIRV 2014</td><td>I do not let women teach or take authority over a man. They must be quiet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ICB 2015</td><td>I do not allow a woman to teach a man or to have authority over a man. She must remain silent.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
Finally, look at 1 Timothy 2:12. Here's what the ICB says at the bottom [verse read]. So there you can see it has the word have, not the word take. The word have is what was in the old NIV and the old NIRV. And thankfully that's what we see in the ICB, as well. So you can see that the ICB is better than the NIRV in these verses, and we can look at many other verses if we had more time. But what I'll just say to you here - it that the NIRV is largely avoiding this drift toward feminism that we see in the NIRV. Its not perfect, there are few places where the ICB does drift toward feminism, and I'll just show you a couple of them really quickly.  
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '51:08', '51:54')">audio</a>

<table border=1><caption>Ezekiel 2:1</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NIRV 2014</td><td>He said to me, "Son of man, stand up on your feet. I will speak to you."</td></tr>
<tr><td>ICB 2015</td><td>He said to me, "Human being, stand up on your feet. Then I will speak with you."</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
Look at Ezekiel 2:1. The NIRV says [verse read]. But look at the ICB here [verse read]. The NIRV is more literal here. The Hebrew text has 2 words, one that means son, one that means man. And the ICB is taking a more gender neutral, non-literal approach here - human being. Now this isn't a huge deal, it's obvious in the context that Ezekiel is a man, but it's just not a literal translation, and it is moving toward a more gender neutral idea. So I don't approve of this, at least it's not pervasive, we don't see these sorts of things all the time in the ICB like we do in the NIRV. This is one of the rare times that the NIRV is actually better than the ICB.

<table border=1><caption>Daniel 7:13</caption>
<tr><th>Version</th><th>Verse</th></tr>
<tr><td>NIRV 2014</td><td>"In my vision I saw one who looked like a son of man. He was coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Eternal God. He was led right up to him.["]</td></tr>
<tr><td>ICB 2015</td><td>"In my vision at night I looked. There in front of me was someone who looked like a human being. He was coming with clouds in the sky. He came near God, who has been alive forever. And he was led to God.["]</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="border1">
I'll show you one more example, its very similar, Daniel 7:13 says [verse read]. So that' the NIRV 2014. Now look at the ICB from 2015 [verse read]. Notice we have the same change here, we have human being instead of son of man. And this one is a little more problematic because this verse is pointing forward to someone in the future. Who is that? This is talking about the messiah, this is referring to Jesus. And you might remember that throughout the gospels Jesus refers to himself with the phrase son of man. Why does he do that? He's pointing back to this prophecy. He's saying I'm the messiah who was prophesied in Daniel 7. And in the ICB we have to phrase son of man in the new testament when Jesus is referring to himself, but we don't have that connection preserved here in the ICB. Its preserved in the NIRV, not in the ICB. So I'm not going to stand before you and tell you that I agree with everything about the ICB. There are a few problems with it, but the problems are far fewer and not as serious in general compared to the NIRV. So I can recommend the 2015 ICB to you, especially for young children and people were learning English as a second language - it is very valuable for those groups of people.

<h3 id="summary2">summaries, equivalence numbers, and reading level</h3>

<p class="border1">
And so I'm not going to say its perfect, but I wouldn't say any translation is perfect. I would make changes to every single bible translation out there. The issue is not you know whether translation is perfect or not, but how close it is to being perfect. You know, how many changes would we need to make to improve it and the fewer the changes and the less series the changes, the more I can recommend it to you. But yeah, every translation has things that I would disagree with and thankfully many of them are not serious issues. But when they get to be more serious and more numerous then I have to say no thanks. I am not a fan of that translation, I don't recommend it. I'm not saying never read it, never look at it, but would I recommend you use as one of your primary translations? No, maybe just look at it from time to time and compare it with the ones that are more trustworthy. 
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '54:11', '54:54')">audio</a>

<p class="border1">
Here I want to just finish by putting these 3 translations on that spectrum that we have between 1 and 100, between perfect formal equivalence and perfect dynamic equivalence. So lets start with the ICB be here. I would put this at the number 70, so it definitely leans more toward dynamic equivalence because of the shorter sentences and the limited vocabulary. That gives us a great trade off. It now reads at very low reading level - 3rd grade. So this is really low, this is something that young children can read and understand. So that's a good trade off. I think this is an example of why you might wanna make a translation more toward dynamic equivalence so it's much more readable, something that kids can read now.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '54:54', '55:33')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
The NIRV reads at the same exact reading level. I would be tempted to maybe put it a little lower than the ICB, but both editions claim that they read at a 3rd grade level so I'll just follow along with that. The NIRV though is not as literal as the ICB. It leans even more toward dynamic equivalence, so I put the number 80 there. That's mainly due to all the changes in the pronouns that are in the NIRV. It's not literally translating those pronouns. Instead its giving us 2nd person pronouns and plural pronouns when it should be giving us a 3rd person singular pronouns. The NIV I would put at the number 50. The NIV actually does a pretty good job of having a balance between dynamic equivalence and a more literal translation. It kind of goes back and forth between the two and so just from the research I've done, I think it's pretty fair to put it just right about in the middle there, at the number 50. And then this reads at an 8th grade level. So nowhere as readable as those other 2 translations, but more readable then all the other ones we looked at earlier.
<a href="javascript:bibleStudyAudio2(btPt8, '55:32', '56:30')">audio</a>
</p>

<p class="border1">
And that is one of the benefits on the NIV. It's just unfortunate that with all these changes in the updated edition, it's no longer very reliable. So I can't recommend the NIV - I liked it before. I found it to be a helpful, readable translation, but with that all these changes in the newest one, I can't recommend it. Thankfully though there will be translations in the future that I can recommend, to go with the NASB. We're not going to be just stuck with the NASB as the only good solid translation. I'll be giving you several others, that I like, but the NIV, unfortunately is not one of them - well I guess I've already given you the ICB. But this is for a limited purpose - I would only recommend it for maybe speed reading, if you want to speed read through a translation, that'll help you. Or if you have kids at home who need help, give them this bible and that'll help them. And people learning English as a second language - it's good for them as well. But as you get older, it's good to graduate to more advanced translations that are more literal and we have the NASB for that and there will be others in the future that I'll recommend also.

<h3 id="prayer2">prayer 2</h3>

<p class="border1">
Let's close in prayer. Thank you Lord for your word and thank you for different translations that we have available. But Lord we know that there is a push toward unbiblical concepts in our culture and these things have crept into some of our bible translations. So I pray you'd give us wisdom as we continue to evaluate, help us to be able to spot problems in the different translations that are out. We know there's no perfect translation. Help us to find and locate the best translations the ones that are the most accurate and the most helpful for us and to steer clear of the ones that are confusing and misleading and steering us away from good sound biblical teaching. So thank you Lord for your help in this area and continue to grant us wisdom. In Jesus name. Amen.
