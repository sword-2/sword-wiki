<p>a2-6 Bible text assessments:</p>
Where there are limitations on a resource (time, manpower, etc) recommendations for English translations might help focus some efforts.
One bible class by Brad Norman provided recommendations for some English translations as listed in the <a href="https://sword-2.github.io/sword-wiki/1a_initial/8b_references/8b.html#church">church references</a>. These recommendations are being added to the table below as they are learned, Lord willing. The recommendations have the perspectives of how the translators did with formal and dynamic equivalence.  Permissions and copyrights may not be a factor. There is an equivalence score which is a number between 1 and 100. 1 represents a perfect formal equivalence (literal), and 100 perfect dynamic equivalence.

<table border=1><caption>Recommendations</caption>
<tr><th>Translation</th><th>recommendation</th><th>equivalence score</th><th>reading level</th><th></th>Comments</tr>
<tr><td>KJV</td><td>not recommended</td><td>15</td><td>12th grade</td><td>The King James Version (KJV) was good for its time. But there is archaic language and new work by translators found there are some imperfections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ASV</td><td>not recommended</td><td>12</td><td>12th grade</td><td>The American Standard Version is better than KJV (better manuscript support, etc). But it is just as hard to read as the KJV.</td></tr>
<tr><td>RSV</td><td>not recommended</td><td>22</td><td>11th grade</td><td>The Revised Standard Version (RSV) has theological problems and archaic pronouns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NASB 2020</td><td>recommenced</td><td>17</td><td>10th grade</td><td>Only minor flaws capitalized pronouns, italics instead of brackets, all caps for old testament quotes. [For some reason one SWORD bishop app has an older NASB version, not the 2020]</td></tr>
