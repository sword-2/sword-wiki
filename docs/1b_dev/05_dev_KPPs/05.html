<!-- recommendation summaries from
	Brad's class. 7/16/23: Bible Translations: Part 7. times 08:10-14:00 delivered on promise to rate the translations covered so far
-->
The scriptures are believed to be without error. For bible readers, some translations are more reliable than others which means some translations can receive recommendations for bible study and others just looked at from time to time. A table of recommendations is being derived (copied) from the <a href="https://sword-2.github.io/sword-wiki/1a_initial/8b_references/8b.html#church">(everyword)</a> Sunday school class to be able to navigate a little faster. The table below is like a contents for class notes as they are input. the equivalence score is a number between 1 and 100. 1 represents a perfect formal equivalence (literal word-for-word) translation, and 100 perfect dynamic equivalence (thought-for-thought) translation.

<table border=1><caption>Recommendations</caption>

If permissions are not available for recommended bibles, remaining translations, even if not recommended, may be practical at least for developing or maintaining software that would eventually load a recommended translation. This prevents a situation where a program can't be easily tested because no bible is available to load (no permissions). Also, the recommendations could be a priority for those doing programming or data entry if there is limited time, manpower, or finance available to keep up with every translation.
