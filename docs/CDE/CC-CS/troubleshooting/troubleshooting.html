<h2 id="intro">introduction</h2>

<p>When computing systems do not work as intended, troubleshooting strategies help people solve the problems. In early grades, students learn that identifying the problem is the first step to fixing it. As they progress, students learn systematic problem-solving processes and how to develop their own troubleshooting strategies based on a deeper understanding of how computing systems work.</p>

	<td>Communicating About Computing - bible translation version currency. The bishop app's library menu had a Modules pick list with an option for the Lockman Foundation. Selection of the Lockman Foundation choice displayed the NASB (New American Standard Bible). But selecting the NASB for install produced a description with dates that only went up to 1995. A newer NASB for 2020 had been reported. Was the SWORD module using an older 1995 version?</td>

	<td>Linux console / vim</td><td>The vim tool was an open source editor that could read files, code software, etc. Thus it had potential to read old testament Hebrew scriptures and code software to facilitate those scriptures in bible apps and web servers. But if Hebrew scriptures were not automatically displayed correctly in vim, troubleshooting steps for at least one field of computer science might be attempted such as:

	<ul>
	<li>Assess if the existing help documents are adequate:
		<ul>
			<li>vim tool: ":help Hebrew".</li>
			<li>Linux: man locale</li>
			<li>Linux: man 5 console-setup</li>
		</ul>
	<li>If unsuccessful displaying Hebrew using the existing help documents, continued troubleshooting might include ... 
		<ul>
			<li>Investigate and attempt to describe the status of displaying different fonts outside of the usual.</li>
			<li>Assess if the console or vim can have a built-in-test to load and display one Hebrew verse like Genesis 1:1 to see this work.</li>
			<li>If any confusion is observed on the internet software boards, consider a post to minimize confusion.</li>
		</ul>
