<h2 id="intro">introduction</h2>

<p>When computing systems do not work as intended, troubleshooting strategies help people solve the problems. In early grades, students learn that identifying the problem is the first step to fixing it. As they progress, students learn systematic problem-solving processes and how to develop their own troubleshooting strategies based on a deeper understanding of how computing systems work.</p>

	<td>Communicating About Computing - bible translation version currency. The status of permissions for the New American Standard Bible (NASB) was unknown and this is just an observation. The bishop app's module for the NASB module reported a 1995 version. It was estimated the SWORD module was the 1995 version and not the newer 2020 version based on the first change to Genesis 1:21 reported <a href="https://j.hn/nasb-1995-nasb-2020-every-change/">here</a>.
	<ul>
		<li>Genesis 1:21 And God created the great sea <s>monsters</s>creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, <s>after</s>according to its kind; and every winged bird <s>after</s>according to its kind; and God saw that it was good.</li>
	</ul>
	The bishop app's library menu had a Modules pick list with an option for the Lockman Foundation. Selection of the Lockman Foundation choice displayed the NASB.</td>
