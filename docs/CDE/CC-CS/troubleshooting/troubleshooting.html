<h2 id="intro">introduction</h2>

<p>When computing systems do not work as intended, troubleshooting strategies help people solve the problems. In early grades, students learn that identifying the problem is the first step to fixing it. As they progress, students learn systematic problem-solving processes and how to develop their own troubleshooting strategies based on a deeper understanding of how computing systems work.</p>

	<li>Assess if the vim editors' help documentation for Hebrew text (:help Hebrew) is adequate to get the Hebrew to display.</li>
	<li>If unsuccessful displaying Hebrew using the help, assess whether a built in test is possible and if it would increase the reliability of reading / writing Hebrew in vim. For example, loading just one verse like Genesis 1:1 and displaying it to the operator.</li>
